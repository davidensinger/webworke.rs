<h2>Life and Craft in Columbus, OH</h2>
<p class="lede">Webworke.rs is a website about folks who make websites in Columbus, OH. We exist to promote our fellow denizens of design and development by featuring both their words and work. Our goal is to draw attention to the great quality of creative and technical output in our city, as too often we seek inspiration from afar, instead of nearby. We are committed to being inclusive by profiling people regardless of their background, experience, or discipline.</p>
