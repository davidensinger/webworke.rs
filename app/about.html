<h2>Life and Craft in Columbus, OH</h2>
<p>Webworke.rs is a website about folks who make websites in Columbus, OH. We exist to promote our fellow denizens of design and development by featuring their words and work on our site. Our goal is to draw attention to the great creative and technical output in our city, as too often inspiration is sought from the coasts, instead of locally. We are committed to being inclusive by profiling people regardless of their background, experience, or discipline.</p>
