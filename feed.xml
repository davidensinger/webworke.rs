It clicked with me like no other thing ever has, which is probably the experience most people had, unless you grew up with it. I didn’t grow up with it, so it just fascinated me to where I decided, “I need to learn how to do this.”</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><picture><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-portrait-480by480-123f22.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-portrait-320by320-123f22.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-portrait-480by480-123f22.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-portrait-320by320-123f22.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-portrait-500by500-123f22.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-portrait-480by480-123f22.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-portrait-320by320-123f22.jpg" alt="Bryce Thornton" ></picture><div class="media-caption">Bryce Thornton is a Web Development Manager at <a href="https://www.highlights.com/" class="media-link">Highlights for Children</a>.</div></div><p>I didn’t know how to program, but I wanted to learn, so I majored in computer science when I went to college. The first two years I learned the  basics of programming, but nothing to do with the web. I was really just itching to learn, so I took it upon myself to figure out the basics of HTML and CSS, even though CSS wasn’t much of thing back then.</p><p>In 1999 I got an internship at Marathon Oil and there was a web team there, although I wasn’t part of it, but I worked right next to them. They had one guy named <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/">Jeremy Zawodny</a>, who was their Mr. Web Guy. His team was building all this cool stuff and I thought, “I want to be like him and do this work.”</p><p>In the evenings I would spend my time learning HTML, Perl, and Apache, so that I could run my own servers. I was one hundred percent into it and from there I just never stopped.</p><p class="question"><strong>What languages are you most interested in now that you’re not writing Perl?</strong></p><p>I’ve been into Ruby on Rails for over ten years now. I don’t get to do as much development any more, so I can’t say that I use it much. Beyond that, there are so many JavaScript frameworks that I’d like to try, like Backbone and Angular. We use them at work, but I don’t personally get a chance to develop with them.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-small media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><p class="quote-text">In the evenings I would spend my time learning HTML, Perl, and Apache, so that I could run my own servers. I was one hundred percent into it and from there I just never stopped.</p></blockquote><p>I’m always reading about new frameworks and languages. I wish I had the time to play with them. Go in particular seems to be popular. But really, if it comes down to working on a site, I’m going to use Rails because that’s what I know and it’s still a very viable framework. It hasn’t stagnated like a lot of languages. Rails has done it right and is still innovative after all these years.</p><p class="question"><strong>So you can get spun up quickly when you want to develop an idea?</strong></p><p>Yeah. Rails is quick to develop in, although I’m probably rusty, so I’d need to look some things up. I really like the speed of development of Ruby as a language, which is why Rails is so great. There have been so many frameworks that have tried to emulate it. Some do an okay job, but Ruby as a language is why Rails is so great. You can make it do anything in a very elegant way with a short amount of code.</p><p>I was all in on Ruby from 2005 to 2009. I used to go to the <a href="http://columbusrb.com/">Columbus Ruby Brigade</a> quite often, but then I had my first son and could no longer justify going, especially when it moved from being downtown. It was super convenient because I could stop by after work. I keep telling myself that I’m going to go, but it never feels like the right time. Now my kids are sick, so I won’t go tonight.</p><p class="question"><strong>Your wife would hate you.</strong></p><p>[Laughing] That’s the thing. I don’t want to leave her with two kids. It’s a lot of work having two kids at home, especially sick kids.</p><p>I’m really trying to attend more tech networking events this year. I used to go to a lot of them, so I’m trying to be more diligent about making myself go. I even told my wife that one night a month I’m going to go out, which she’s okay with. But I’ve been away from home for work a lot recently, so I don’t want to push my limits because it’s not fair to her.</p><p class="question"><strong>Let’s talk about <a href="https://www.highlights.com/">Highlights</a>. What’s your role there?</strong></p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="https://www.highlights.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-logo-highlights-480by253-84e467.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-logo-highlights-320by169-84e467.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-logo-highlights-480by253-84e467.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-logo-highlights-320by169-84e467.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-logo-highlights-720by380-84e467.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-logo-highlights-480by253-84e467.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-logo-highlights-320by169-84e467.jpg" alt="Highlights Magazine" ></picture></a></div><p>I’m a web development manager. I was hired to work for the Highlights brand, which is our consumer business side where we sell our magazines and merchandise direct to consumers.</p><p>I no longer work specifically for Highlights, but instead I work for <a href="https://www.zaner-bloser.com/">Zaner-Bloser</a>, which is a subsidiary company. We work on one system, what we refer to as our digital product delivery (DPD) platform. It’s based on Drupal and is built for schools to access all the digital products we sell. In some ways it’s like a learning management system. It’s my complete focus at this point.</p><p class="question"><strong>What's a typical day like? Do you have any time to do development?</strong></p><p>I’m a manager, so a typical day for me is a ton of meetings. It’s not as bad as it sounds, though. I try to only attend the meetings that I absolutely need to attend. I do make it a point to be at all of our Agile stuff: our daily stand-up, backlog grooming, sprint planning, and sprint retrospective meetings.</p><p>I was the scrum master for nine months, but we’ve since hired someone to fill that role. That took a lot of my time. I have a little more flexibility in my schedule now that I’m not as involved with the planning. If I do any development work it’s just because I want to test something out very quickly, although it’s rare for that to ever happen.</p><p class="question"><strong>What products does Highlights have other than the magazine? There’s a surprising amount of websites too, right?</strong></p><p>Highlights owns three other education companies: Zaner-Bloser, <a href="http://www.stenhouse.com/">Stenhouse</a>, which is a publishing company, and then <a href="http://staffdevelopmentforeducators.com/">Staff Development for Educators (SDE)</a>, a professional development company. All three subsidiaries are in the education market. Highlights is really focused on children, so the education market is a good fit.</p><p>The bread and butter for Highlights is the magazine itself. There’s also a more recent magazine called High Five, which is focused on younger children and has been huge for the brand. We also have a magazine for babies called Hello, which is waterproof and can’t be ripped apart. Hello launched right when I started at Highlights and that corresponded with the birth of my first child, so it was really good timing for me.</p><p>As for websites, we have almost thirty of them. There’s our main Highlights site, our various sites for all our subsidiaries, and a lot of marketing sites too.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://www.whichwayusa.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-whichwayusa-480by374-155277.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-whichwayusa-320by249-155277.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-whichwayusa-480by374-155277.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-whichwayusa-320by249-155277.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-whichwayusa-720by561-155277.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-whichwayusa-480by374-155277.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-whichwayusa-320by249-155277.jpg" alt="Which Way USA" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">Learn about the states with <a href="http://www.whichwayusa.com/" class="media-link">Which Way USA</a>.</div></div><p>We have one site for a product called <a href="http://www.whichwayusa.com/">Which Way USA</a>. I managed the project to build the site, which is probably our most interactive, outside of Highlights Kids. It has a bunch of games that you can play to learn about the fifty states. Every month you get a new booklet that has a code to unlock a state on the website. You can then play games at various locations within that state. It’s pretty cool, although it was a big challenge for me when I started.</p><p>Highlights is doing a lot of cool stuff. We’re getting more into native apps, both iOS and Android. We have a full time app developer now, which we never had before. As a company we’re investing a lot of time, money, and energy into digital over the past few years. We’re doing it right because we know that we have to.</p><p class="question"><strong>Which product are you most proud of?</strong></p><p>Which Way USA was a great project. I had one developer who worked for me on that project, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianweaver1">Brian Weaver</a>. We worked very hard over the course of a year, without much of a project management methodology. We weren’t using Agile at the time and we didn’t have business analysts to help gather requirements. I was brand new and they basically said, “Here you go. Can you figure this out?”</p><p>We were able to launch it on time and we’ve continued to iterate on it since then. To me that was just a big win because we were scrappy. I wouldn’t want to work like that for every project, but it still felt good to launch that one. And Brian did so much good work, as did our vendor, <a href="http://jerseycow.com/">Jersey Cow</a>, who did all the game development.</p><p class="question"><strong>How was the transition to Agile?</strong></p><p>There wasn’t much in the way of oversight for project management until we implemented Agile. I had read about it, but had never done it in practice. We had some developers who were passionate about it, so they pushed hard for us to implement it. We also got a new CIO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-blum/23/a4a/230">David Blum</a>, who felt just as strongly about it.</p><p>We had various information sessions, which was a great learning experience, and we just went from there. It was a little rough at first because I had no idea how to put together an Agile team. I definitely fumbled at times, but got good feedback, and now our team’s processes are set and we’re in a good flow.</p><p>Everyone knows what they’re supposed to be doing at all times. You always know who to talk to if you need answers for things. It’s been fantastic. I wouldn’t want to do anything else unless it were similar to Agile. I just love the process and structure of it.</p><p class="question"><strong>Let’s talk about personal projects. Tell me about <a href="http://chatterjet.com/">ChatterJet</a>.</strong></p><p>I developed ChatterJet with <a href="http://webworke.rs/matthew-russo/">Matt Russo</a>, who I met through Twitter, actually. A mutual friend, I can’t remember who, retweeted Matt’s request for help with an idea he had. At the time I was open to try something new, so we met up and he explained his plan to me. I dabbled around with it and realized that I could do what he was looking for.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://chatterjet.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-chatterjet-480by374-d818da.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-chatterjet-320by249-d818da.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-chatterjet-480by374-d818da.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-chatterjet-320by249-d818da.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-chatterjet-720by561-d818da.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-chatterjet-480by374-d818da.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-chatterjet-320by249-d818da.jpg" alt="ChatterJet" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption"><a href="http://chatterjet.com/" class="media-link">ChatterJet</a> helps small businesses improve their social media engagement.</div></div><p>ChatterJet was built to help small businesses, like a coffee shop, engage with their local users. It listens for people who are talking about coffee, so that the coffee shop can reply, “Hey, come in for a discount on your next cup.” It also finds articles from around the web, which can then be posted as a link on Twitter or Facebook.</p><p>We automated that process because a lot of people who run small businesses don’t bother to do it or don’t know how. Matt was the brains behind it and planned out the whole approach, while I developed the backend.</p><p>It was a fun project, although we’re not actively pushing it anymore. It didn’t gain a lot of traction, even though it was a good idea. We had a lot of users, but we had a hard time getting good feedback from them. A common response was, “Eh. It’s okay. It’s just not what I’m looking for.” We didn’t give up on it, we really tried to get feedback.</p><p>Some users are going to get good results, but others won’t. Our system tries to use keywords and sites to find content that’s relevant to the business. For some industries it’s easier to churn out quality content, but others are going to get all sorts of content, from good to bad. Without a more hands on approach it’s difficult to ensure that they get consistently good content.</p><p>I still use it and I think Matt still uses it. We have it turned on. I get my email every day and I still find it really interesting. I found a lot of people on Twitter who I wouldn’t normally follow. I still think that it’s a viable business opportunity, but you’d really need to iterate on it to ensure that it’s a valuable service for your customers.</p><p class="question"><strong>What’s <a href="http://www.offsitestatus.com/">OffsiteStatus</a>?</strong></p><p>OffsiteStatus is a hosted status page for websites. It’s a way for you to communicate with your customers when your site goes down. The alternative is to host your own status page, but that would probably go down with the rest of your site, just by the very nature of your infrastructure. The less you’re involved with your status page the more likely that it will stay up and serve its purpose of informing your customers of what’s happening.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://www.offsitestatus.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-offsitestatus-480by374-ee5671.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-offsitestatus-320by249-ee5671.png"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-offsitestatus-480by374-ee5671.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-offsitestatus-320by249-ee5671.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-offsitestatus-720by561-ee5671.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-offsitestatus-480by374-ee5671.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-offsitestatus-320by249-ee5671.png" alt="OffsiteStatus" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption"><a href="http://www.offsitestatus.com/" class="media-link">OffsiteStatus</a> provides an off-site, hosted system status page for SaaS applications.</div></div><p>The idea first popped into my head when I saw that several sites I follow had one, like GitHub and 37 Signals. I wanted one for a project that I was working on and I thought, “There’s probably a service out there for this,” but I looked and I couldn’t find one. It seemed like a very obvious fit for software as a service. And trust me that I looked hard because that’s my first instinct when I have an idea. I want to find out who else is doing it and how well they’re doing it.</p><p>So I wrote it down as a note in Evernote and I sat on it for a couple of months. It kept coming back to me and I thought, “I really should do this.” It didn’t seem that difficult to implement, but of course no project seems difficult when you start. I asked a lot of people for feedback, but it didn’t really click with them, which I understand if you’ve never had customers who rely on your sites being up. If your users are paying for your service then they’re paying for your site to be up and available during the day.</p><p>I built it over the course of a few months, put it out there, and it didn’t get a lot of traction up front, but over the past few years I’ve had consistent signups. I have quite a few customers who use it, so it’s proven its value. The issue now is that there are a lot of competitors offering the same service.</p><p class="question"><strong>I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/brycethornton/status/357497236864770049">your tweet</a> about OffsiteStatus being mentioned on TechCrunch in an article about a competing service, <a href="https://www.statuspage.io/">StatusPage.io</a>. What makes the difference for a project in terms of visibility or traction?</strong></p><p>A project will gain traction if you push it hard enough and are savvy enough to get it in front of the right people. I didn’t do much of that because my wife and I were having our first kid around that same time. I really think you need to put in the effort to get the project in front of a lot of people to get their feedback. You also need to reach out to the media to get coverage. It’s not in my nature to do that as a lone developer, I would rather developer another feature.</p><p>The developers of StatusPage.io did a fantastic job. They’re a Y Combinator company, so they got that whole network and the exposure and feedback that comes with it. They built a really slick product with all the features that I’ve wanted to build, but that I just don’t have the time for. A lot of big sites use them, which is a little frustrating [laughing] because I can immediately recognize their site when I see it. Props to them. They did it right.</p><p>I have thought about getting some help, but I don’t even have the time to onboard additional developers. I haven’t done a lot with the site, so it’s still fairly basic when you compare it to its competitors, but it’s also free. I’ve actually built a lot of the code for a premium version, I just have to turn it on. It will just be a slow going project for me, so long as I still enjoy doing it.</p><p class="question"><strong>Tell me about <a href="http://www.freshnews.org/">FreshNews</a>.</strong></p><p>FreshNews was my first side project, so it’s got a special place in my heart. Back when I first got into the web I was looking for a project and there was no great way to aggregate news. These days we’ve got RSS readers, but back then there was none of that. I read a lot of tech news sites and I was visiting them pretty often to check for updates.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://www.freshnews.org/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-freshnews-480by374-167077.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-freshnews-320by249-167077.png"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-freshnews-480by374-167077.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-freshnews-320by249-167077.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-freshnews-720by561-167077.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-freshnews-480by374-167077.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-freshnews-320by249-167077.png" alt="FreshNews" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption"><a href="http://www.freshnews.org/" class="media-link">FreshNews</a>, a news aggregator.</div></div><p>I realized that I could aggregate the updates, so I started FreshNews. I initially wrote the backend in Perl. I wanted to learn PHP, which is what I used for the frontend. I eventually ended up writing the whole thing in PHP, although now it’s been rewritten with Rails. It was a great learning experience for me to learn all of these technologies.</p><p>The aggregation piece of it was a nightmare in 2000 because there wasn’t a real RSS standard. There was RDF, which Slashdot had and it’s basically an XML feed. I didn’t know of any parsing libraries, so I just did it all in regular expressions. It was brittle [laughing] because people would change the markup that I was scraping to get the headlines. It was a heck of a learning experience.</p><p>I remember the first time I saw that someone from the Netherlands had visited the site and I thought, “Holy crap, this is amazing!” The site actually got a lot of users and it got coverage too. In 2004 it was covered on <em>The Screen Savers</em> on Tech TV, which I actually watched back then. I still have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ0fXphrlsM">the clip on YouTube</a> too.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-full"><p class="quote-text">I remember the first time I saw that someone from the Netherlands had visited the site and I thought, “Holy crap, this is amazing!”</p></blockquote><p>The site has been a great experiment for me over the years.

We came up with a bunch of different ideas, but a group of us didn’t feel great about any one of them, so we decided to do something different. A couple of the guys on the team had already bought the EventStart domain, which they had already began work on. An event registration site sounded good, plus the domain name was good, so we worked on it over the weekend.</p><p>At the end of the weekend most of the team members didn’t have the time to work on it, so after a few months it ended up just being me. I didn’t know if I really wanted to pursue it, but at the time I didn’t have any other side projects that were really interesting to me. People knew about it from Startup Weekend, so I wanted to see how far I could take it.</p><p>I worked on EventStart for nearly two years and then I shut it down. It looked really nice and functionally worked well. The biggest challenge was differentiating it from Eventbrite, which was the biggest player with all the features. Even if I had beaten them on price, it would have been difficult to get users who were more comfortable with them since they were established.</p><p>It was a great learning experience. I did a ton of development on it and I’m glad I did it. For the 2009 Startup Weekend I convinced them to use EventStart for their registration, which was cool.</p><p class="question"><strong>What’s <a href="http://testingbenfordslaw.com/">Testing Benford’s Law</a>? You worked with <a href="http://blackantmedia.com/">Jason Long</a> on it, right?</strong></p><p>Yeah, so Jason Long is a pretty important person in my history. I met him at a meetup in 2004 and he was the one who showed me Rails for the first time. That very same evening he showed me <a href="http://log.maniacalrage.net/">a blog</a> where you could get live search results as you typed into the search field. It didn’t have a name since Ajax wasn't a term back then, but it just blew me away. Ajax seems obvious now, but at the time it didn’t exist!</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://testingbenfordslaw.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-benfordslaw-480by323-d56fa9.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-benfordslaw-320by215-d56fa9.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-benfordslaw-480by323-d56fa9.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-benfordslaw-320by215-d56fa9.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-benfordslaw-720by484-d56fa9.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-benfordslaw-480by323-d56fa9.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/06-bryce-thornton-screenshot-benfordslaw-320by215-d56fa9.jpg" alt="Testing Benford’s Law" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption"><a href="http://testingbenfordslaw.com/" class="media-link">Testing Benford’s Law</a>, a collaboration with <a href="http://blackantmedia.com/">Jason Long</a>.</div></div><p>In 2011 Jason put out a tweet asking for help on an idea he had to test Benford’s Law. I thought it was a pretty cool idea, so we built a site to demonstrate it with various datasets that we pulled from the web. We didn’t know if it would follow the law, but we wanted to see how close it would come. It turned out that most of the datasets follow the law pretty closely, which is reassuring since it’s a law.</p><p>The site is open source, so you can go to GitHub and do a pull request to add additional datasets. Most of the datasets we have were submitted by contributors. For the project, Jason was the designer and I did the development work. It turned out really well. We even got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2701342">the top spot on Hacker News for a day</a>. It was a really fun small project.</p><p class="question"><strong>Is it hard to find time for side projects now that you’ve got kids?</strong></p><p>My side projects have definitely been the first thing to go. Work takes priority during my day and then family in the evenings. I get home and immediately switch into dad mode until probably 9:00 PM when the kids are in bed. By that time I’m pretty tired and I just don’t have the mental capacity to focus on development.</p><p>The only time I really work on my side projects is if I take a day off from work. Sometimes I’ll go to a coffee shop and knock out some bug fixes or implement a small feature from the backlog. I still have ideas, but I just don’t have the time to work on them. I miss that, but I’m also very happy being a dad and having a family. It’s a good trade-off.</p><p class="question"><strong>I read one of <a href="https://twitter.com/brycethornton/status/536715849801818112">your tweets</a> where you wrote that you had a mental dry spell after your first kid. That must relate to the exhaustion that comes with being a parent.</strong></p><p>It does. When you’re doing a lot of work with the web your brain is just churning with thoughts. But when you’re away from it, it’s just like anything else in that you get a little rusty. I just don’t have the time or energy to really put forth that much level of thought. When the kids become more predictable in their sleep schedules I’ll have more time to start thinking about the web again.</p><p>I still use Evernote. It’s a good history of my ideas because I jot them all down in the app. I still enjoy coming up with the occasional idea and then letting it marinate in my head to see if it’s viable. I try to find someone who’s doing something similar, but if I can’t anything and the idea sticks with me, I do it. A lot like how OffsiteStatus came to be.</p><p class="question"><strong>What are your interests outside of web development?</strong></p><p>I am of course interested in my family and hopefully raising good kids.</p><p>My main hobby now is CrossFit, which has definitely supplanted my side projects. I love it because it’s challenging, it feels great, and I stay in good shape. I know I’ve got that hour and then I can move on with my day. For side projects you need a lot of mental ramp up to get into, which makes getting anything done in an hour difficult, especially when you want to keep going.</p><p>CrossFit is different. I feel less stressed after CrossFit and I go into work feeling great. I would recommend it to anybody, especially morning CrossFit. It just feels so good to go into work so mentally alert and ready for the day. My wife and I take turns going at 5:30 AM. We’ve met so many good friends at CrossFit because it’s a real community.</p><p class="question"><strong>What goals do you have, either personal, career, or CrossFit?</strong></p><p>For work I’ve got a big project to find a new platform for Zaner-Bloser to post their products on. So I’m just working towards that and hoping that it will go well. I have no plans to make a career move, I’m definitely happy at Highlights.</p><p>Most of my personal goals revolve around CrossFit [laughing]. A couple times a week I go to the gym during my lunch break to work on my squat, amongst other things. That goal drives me, so I’ve got a plan for the entire year to get to where I want to be.</p><p>Outside of that, I’d like to get back into attending meetups and networking events. I’m not doing great with that, but it’s still a goal. At least once a month I want to meet people and learn something new. I don’t want to do it just for the networking aspect.</p><p>My unwritten goals are to be a good husband and dad. It’s difficult to set anything tangible, but I just want to be there for my kids and for my wife. I think we do a good job as parents, so we’ll keep that up.</p><br><hr><p>You’ve just read about <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/bryce-thornton/">Bryce Thornton</a></strong> on <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/">Webworke.rs</a></strong>, a website about folks who make websites in Columbus, OH.</p><p>For updates, follow us on <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Webworkers614">Facebook</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://plus.google.com/+Webworkers614/">Google+</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/webworkers">LinkedIn</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://Webworkers614.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Webworkers614">Twitter</a></strong>.</p>

I heard that you had quite the career.</strong></p><p>When I was three and a half I was given my first motorcycle from my dad. He was big into motocross before I came along and wanted to pass that skill and experience to me. I raced for that whole next summer and then started kindergarten. I raced every weekend and actually learned how to ride a motorcycle before I learned how to ride a bike. My show and tell item at school was always the trophy I won the week before. I raced competitively on a circuit for the next twelve years. It was a very non-traditional childhood, but it’s always a good story.</p><p class="question"><strong>I didn’t realize that motocross competitions for kids would be so demanding of your time.</strong></p><p>Oh, absolutely. It felt like I spent more time traveling than going to school. When I turned sixteen years old I had the opportunity to go pro, but at that point I was tired of racing. I had done it for twelve years and never had much of a social life.</p><p class="question"><strong>So you were burned out?</strong></p><p>I really was. I raced for so long without having the option of stopping. I wanted to hangout with my friends instead of just racing all the time, so I took a few years off and got into cars. When I was nineteen I bought a street bike, and I started doing stunting on that. It was just so dangerous and there were so many crashes.</p><p class="question"><strong>I would think!</strong></p><p>It got out of hand and I lost a few friends to it. When I was twenty I became a father and that was it. It would have been selfish of me to risk my life, so I sold the bike and just quit. There are videos out there of me doing different stunts. When I watch them I can’t believe that I didn’t get more hurt.</p><p>One of the last big crashes that I had I wasn’t wearing a helmet, which was stupid of me. I was doing an endo, which is when you ride on your front wheel. I clipped a road reflector and it kicked the handlebars back and forth and flipped me off. I slammed into the ground and sliced my head open and that led to three layers of stitches.</p><p>Every once in a while I’ll hop on a bike, but I just can’t control myself and end up doing a wheelie or an endo. It’s still fun to me, but I can’t touch them so that I don’t get hurt.</p><p class="question"><strong>But you look good! I wouldn’t have thought that you had such a bad crash.</strong></p><p>My stepdad is a physician, so I called him and asked, “Hey should I go to the ER? Or should I just come to your office? I’m going to need some stitches.” He stitched up my leg and face and to this day my forehead on the left side is pretty numb. Most of the nerve endings have been sliced in there. That was my last big crash and the moment when I realized that I had to stop.</p><p class="question"><strong>So being a designer is a safer vocation?</strong></p><p>Yeah, a little bit [laughing].</p><p class="question"><strong>How did you get into designing for the web?</strong></p><p>A friend of mine, who did video production work, was using Photoshop to design street bike posters. I was just amazed at how he was able to manipulate the photos and at how powerful Photoshop was, so I started playing with it too. That is what got me started.</p><p>I then went to Ohio State for CS, but it didn’t last long enough. The curriculum was outdated and I just wasn’t having it. School just wasn’t for me, especially after growing up and doing motocross. I did the bare minimum of what I had to do and that was it. Learning on my own allowed me to grow at a much faster pace. I was able to stay on top of the most up-to-date technologies and not have to learn about how we used to do it.</p><p>I started my first design gig at a screen printing place in Lima, Ohio, which is where I’m from. I also went back to school at American Intercontinental University Online for visual communications. I lasted about a year there and again, it just wasn’t progressing fast enough for me.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-full"><p class="quote-text">Coding and design is just a hobby. I just happen to get paid for it.</p></blockquote><p>A good friend of mine, and fellow designer, got me an opportunity to do an apprenticeship at a hospital in Lima, which was key to getting me where I am today. I told them, “I want to learn and you don’t even need to pay me. I’ll even work forty hour work weeks.” I moved back in with my parents and worked for free. They liked what I was doing and after a few months asked me to stay on full time.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://finecitizens.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-fine-citizens-logo-480by480-785d56.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-fine-citizens-logo-320by320-785d56.png"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-fine-citizens-logo-480by480-785d56.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-fine-citizens-logo-320by320-785d56.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-fine-citizens-logo-667by667-785d56.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-fine-citizens-logo-480by480-785d56.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-fine-citizens-logo-320by320-785d56.png" alt="Fine Citizens" ></picture></a></div><p>Later on I realized that being in Lima wasn’t going to provide me with the opportunities I needed to further my career. So I pursued some leads and moved to Columbus to work for <a href="http://finecitizens.com/">Fine Citizens</a>. After a couple years of just doing interface design, I jumped into HTML and CSS and initially it was really intimidating.</p><p>What pushed me to learn it was my frustration with the developers who coded my designs. The comps that I would create wouldn’t be translated one-to-one into code. There’s really no excuse for that with the tools we have and the capabilities of the browsers we develop for. I understand that older browsers are limiting, but with newer ones, the design on the page should look nearly identical to the comp. I decided that I had to do the work myself to ensure that it’s done to my expectations.</p><p class="question"><strong>You’re the best judge of how the designs should be developed.</strong></p><p>Yeah and it’s so much faster than sitting with a developer and insisting that something be changed so many times over. “Change this, change that, change that…,” it just makes more sense for me to do it myself.</p><p>I’ve now found that I spend much less time prototyping a design because I switch to code so much more quickly. I know the direction that I’m going towards and start building.</p><p class="question"><strong>So designers should learn to code?</strong></p><p>Absolutely. I didn’t realize how important it was initially. When I worked at Fine Citizens, I went the entire job not doing any coding and I know that our developer was so frustrated with how nitpicky I was about my designs. Designers should do it themselves, so it’s easier for everyone. Designers need to fully understand and embrace the medium that they are designing for. It will only make them a better designer.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://finecitizens.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-neo-logo-480by162-a56be9.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-neo-logo-320by108-a56be9.png"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-neo-logo-480by162-a56be9.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-neo-logo-320by108-a56be9.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-neo-logo-600by203-a56be9.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-neo-logo-480by162-a56be9.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-neo-logo-320by108-a56be9.png" alt="Neo" ></picture></a></div><p>When I worked at <a href="http://www.neo.com/">Neo</a> my development skills really took off because of the brilliant people I was working with. I got to sit in a room full of developers, so I learned development. It’s career-changing, especially when you can build for the medium that you’re designing to. It makes your designs so much easier to translate to code because you know what’s possible and what’s not. I one hundred percent think that all designers should learn how to code HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They’re only going to do themselves a favor by doing so.</p><p>With every engineer that I work with I tell them, “Don’t bother to style anything. Get your part of the code working and then send it back to me.” That’s all I want. It’s so much easier for them because they often don’t want to do it, while I do. Each of us doing what we’re good at.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-small media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><p class="quote-text">Designers need to fully understand and embrace the medium that they are designing for.</p></blockquote><p class="question"><strong>What’s your workflow like?</strong></p><p>I try to get into the code as fast as possible. I use Sketch because a year and a half ago a couple buddies were like, “Dude, you gotta try out Sketch. It’s super awesome.” It took me about a week to get used to it and then I ditched Photoshop.</p><p class="question"><strong>No turning back?</strong></p><p>No turning back! Sketch takes away so much of the fluff that’s in Photoshop that you can’t even do on the web. Everything that you can do in Sketch can be done in CSS, which makes it super convenient to design with. I design the general layout and direction that I want to go in and then start coding. It’s such a waste of time to polish the design on canvas because there’s going to be constraints in the browser that you don’t expect.</p><p class="question"><strong>How do you feel about being a generalist versus being a specialist?</strong></p><p>I am a generalist because I don’t want to restrict myself from learning new things. Nobody in this industry should restrict themselves to only doing one specific thing well. Sure there are specialists who are really good at what they do, but you can’t stop the motivation to learn more.</p><p>Being a generalist also makes you much more marketable as an employee. I’m fortunate enough that I can do the jobs of two people, so you don’t have to employ a developer and a designer.</p><p class="question"><strong>What is Red Guava and what do you do there?</strong></p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="https://www.cliniko.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-logo-480by116-10450b.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-logo-320by77-10450b.png"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-logo-480by116-10450b.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-logo-320by77-10450b.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-logo-600by145-10450b.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-logo-480by116-10450b.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-logo-320by77-10450b.png" alt="Cliniko" ></picture></a></div><p>It’s a great story of how <a href="http://www.redguava.com.au/">Red Guava</a> came to be. <a href="https://twitter.com/jfriedlaender">Joel</a> founded Red Guava as a consulting firm to help fund the development of <a href="https://www.cliniko.com/">Cliniko</a>, which is the practice management software that we build and maintain. Joel’s wife is an osteopath and the software she had available to her was terrible. He quit his job to focus on building the product as an alternative solution to the terrible software solutions that were currently available. He was a .NET developer who wanted to learn Ruby and he used Cliniko as a way to do that.</p><p>Joel assumed that Red Guava was going to need to do consulting work too, but Cliniko just took off. We recently hit 3,000 customers and we’re incredibly proud of that. The company is solely owned by Joel, which is awesome because we don’t need to deal with any pressure from investors. Joel knows what he wants and he’s driving the company to success.</p><p class="question"><strong>Would you speak about your transition to working remotely at Red Guava?</strong></p><p>I thought it was going to be really hard to leave an office, but it’s been easier than I thought it would be. You can really buckle down and be motivated by yourself.</p><p>At Red Guava we have no structured meetings whatsoever. We meet up whenever we have people online, but there’s so much autonomy that if you think that something should be done, you just do it. Joel is very passionate about that. He hires the best people for the job and trusts us to do what’s best for the company. Everyone we work with is just brilliant at what they do.</p><p>Working remotely helps me get started right after I wake up. I don’t have to worry about the commute to work. I can grab my computer and start working within a matter of minutes, which really helps with my productivity. So many studies have shown that people are more productive in the morning. I’ve thought lately that a lot of companies could benefit by having their employees come in at lunch, so that they can crank away as soon as they wake up.</p><p>I usually have my lunch around 11:30 AM, so after that I take a shower, get dressed, and I’m totally refreshed. I’ve already got a lot of stuff done, but now I’m ready to resume working. It’s such an awesome workflow and I didn’t think that it was going to work out that well for me.</p><p>One thing I miss is the commute home, when I would unwind in the car. There would be days when I wouldn’t even turn on the radio, but reflect on what I got done that day and whether it was the right solution.</p><p>There’s another Red Guava developer in Columbus, <a href="https://twitter.com/2john4tv">John</a>, and we alternate working at each other’s homes one day a week. It’s nice to be able to work together like that. <a href="http://www.jasonlong.me/">Jason</a>, who designs at GitHub, lives down the street from me, so I’ll crash at his house some days too. It’s nice to get out of the house because otherwise I wouldn’t ever leave.</p><p>I make it a point to talk with my coworkers through video chat, so that we get that face-to-face interaction. Obviously, it’s difficult because we live so far away, but I want to learn about them as people. Everyone thus far has been extremely awesome and personable. I just got back from Australia a couple weeks ago and got to meet everyone there. It was an experience to meet these people who I only knew through text. I want to know them outside of work too.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-small media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><p class="quote-text">Any designer who wants to learn to code needs to join a consulting firm, specifically Neo if they’re in Columbus, because you’ll work on something different everyday.</p></blockquote><p class="question"><strong>What are the differences between working for a consulting company versus a product company?</strong></p><p>It’s a complete one hundred and eighty degree change. Consulting was a lot of fun, and any designer who wants to learn to code needs to join a consulting firm, specifically Neo if they’re in Columbus, because you’ll work on something different everyday. It played a vital role in where I am today.</p><p>Consulting is difficult because you’re doing work for someone who’s paying you, so they want to control the development decisions. We did have some clients who fully trusted us and they were a lot of fun to work with, but then you have those clients who are really stubborn, and they want to make the decisions even when we’ve told them that something is a bad idea. </p><p>Working for a product is different because we make the decisions for ourselves, so we can do what we think best. Everyone at our company is personally invested in our product and focused on making it the best it can possibly be. Compare this to consulting, when you’re just trying to get it done before a deadline, instead of constantly refining and improving your product.</p><p>The biggest lesson that I’ve learned is how important a good support team is. At Cliniko we have a top-notch support team. If our customers could see the backchannel chat that happens, they would love Cliniko even more. We work so hard to make sure our customers get the practice management software that they need to make their lives easier.</p><p>It’s such a contrast from doing something just to get it done. I hate that so much. It would be difficult for me to go back to a consulting company after working for a product company.</p><p class="question"><strong>So you’re much more diligent about the work you do now?</strong></p><p>Yeah, it’s not about getting the work done quickly, especially at the expense of quality. We don’t give any timeline promises. We want the best code and whatever time it takes to do that, is the time it takes to release a new feature.</p><p>Not having meetings is a crucial part of that because you’re not interrupted while you’re on a roll. It makes me much more productive.</p><p class="question"><strong>What is your workday like? The company is based in Australia, right? How does that work?</strong></p><p>Yeah. The company is based in Melbourne, but we have people in Brazil, Canada, Poland, and the United States too. Our other designer, <a href="https://twitter.com/dont_wake_me_up">Kelly</a>, just travels the world with his wife, which is really cool. We never really know exactly where he is consistently. He pushes code whenever he can get internet access.</p><p>The timezones were very tricky to adapt to and they initially bit me in the butt. It was difficult to adapt from the mindset of wanting feedback on a design before starting development, which is what I did while consulting. Whenever I would have an idea I would send Joel the comps and that would waste a lot of time while I was waiting for his response. I kept noticing that Kelly was just pushing code like mad and I didn’t understand how he kept up that pace.</p><p>Joel and I had a conversation about this and he told me to do whatever I think is right. Sure we might refine a few things, but I don’t waste time waiting for approval before I get started.</p><p class="question"><strong>When do you work?</strong></p><p>We have a thirty-hour work week. Our culture encourages a healthy work life balance, which I really appreciate. I remember saying things like, “My partner’s off today. Is it cool if I take the day off to hang out with her?” Joel would reply, ”If you’re not going to be working then don’t be online. It’s nice of you to ask, but if your partner is at home, spend time with her and just get the work done later.”</p><p>It can be hard to do a thirty-hour work week. Initially I thought that I’d have a lot more time for side projects, but when you get in a groove it’s hard to stop. I start around nine o’clock and hop off at five. Every once in a while I’ll skip a day here and there, but I usually work closer to a forty-hour week.</p><p class="question"><strong>What feature of Cliniko are you most proud of?</strong></p><p>I’m proud of our traction with getting it responsive. One of the reasons they hired me was to help get the product responsive and working on all devices. I’m really passionate about the responsive web. The progress that Kelly and I are making towards that end is going really well.</p><p class="question"><strong>The calendar view is going to be a challenge.</strong></p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://webworke.rs/images/originals/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-nav.png" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-nav-480by291-09df61.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-nav-320by194-09df61.png"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-nav-480by291-09df61.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-nav-320by194-09df61.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-nav-720by437-09df61.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-nav-480by291-09df61.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/05-derek-briggs-cliniko-nav-320by194-09df61.png" alt="Cliniko side navigation" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">A screenshot of the new side navigation that Derek worked on for <a href="https://www.cliniko.com/" class="media-link">Cliniko</a>.</div></div><p>Yeah that’s going to be the most difficult. Kelly has done a really nice redesign, but I it’s going to be quite a task to build. The view on smaller devices is going to be challenging, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.</p><p>I just recently redesigned the navigation from being on the top bar with tabs to being a sidebar with a list. It’s going to work better responsively, especially with most laptops being 16” x 9”. It’s so much nicer to not lose those hundred pixels at the top.</p><p>Our customers don’t usually like change, but we posted a preview of it on Facebook and the feedback was much better than we expected. We thought that they would just roast us, but we had a lot of really positive feedback that motivated us to get the feature out sooner. We’re doing a lot of testing now to ensure that it works well. I’m really, really proud of the work we’ve done on it.</p><p class="question"><strong>What are your interests outside of the web?</strong></p><p>I try to learn a little bit of everything. I don’t like having people come do services at my house when I can do it myself, which usually involves me watching a lot of YouTube videos to learn. I really enjoy learning for the sake of learning.</p><p>I was constantly jumping around from job to job before I discovered web design. I worked at a motorcycle shop, on a production line, at a third shift factory job, as an installer of home theater systems, to car audio installation. I can also do remote starts and mechanic work too.</p><p>My primary hobby is what I do for work. I always say, “Coding and design is just a hobby. I just happen to get paid for it.”</p><p class="question"><strong>Do you have any goals for next year?</strong></p><p>I really don’t set goals because they are always changing. I never know what the next one’s going to be. Usually it comes up and I’m an extremely impatient person, so when something comes up, I usually try to hit that goal as fast as I can.</p><br><hr><p>You’ve just read about <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/derek-briggs/">Derek Briggs</a></strong> on <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/">Webworke.rs</a></strong>, a website about folks who make websites in Columbus, OH.</p><p>For updates, follow us on <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Webworkers614">Facebook</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://plus.google.com/+Webworkers614/">Google+</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/webworkers">LinkedIn</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://Webworkers614.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Webworkers614">Twitter</a></strong>.</p>

When not doing development, she can be found playing music and living healthfully.<p><p class="question"><strong>How did you get started as a web developer?</strong></p><p>My start was a little different than most because I didn’t intend to become a developer. I was just a business owner who needed a website. We asked our internet provider for suggestions and they recommended <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. After a little searching, it looked like WordPress was perfect for us, so I started learning everything I could about it.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><picture><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-portrait-460by460-5877a6.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-portrait-320by320-5877a6.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-portrait-460by460-5877a6.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-portrait-320by320-5877a6.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-portrait-460by460-5877a6.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-portrait-460by460-5877a6.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-portrait-320by320-5877a6.jpg" alt="Jan Milosh" ></picture><div class="media-caption">Jan Milosh is a Test Engineer at <a href="https://www.covermymeds.com/" class="media-link">CoverMyMeds</a>.</div></div><p>I ended up purchasing a theme from <a href="http://cyberchimps.com/">CyberChimps.com</a>. They had a great support forum where I was able to get instructions for applying custom CSS to my theme. At that time, I knew nothing and it all seemed very foreign to me. I was impressed by how helpful their support guy was and how he would encourage people to learn more, even giving links to learning resources. This was my inspiration to dig deeper and keep learning. Looking back, I would say that this support person was an important influence and inspiration.</p><p>After I got my first site launched, I decided to create a blog, which was another WordPress site. After six months of experimenting with WordPress, I decided to build my own theme. That caused me to dig a lot deeper into PHP and my own HTML/CSS. After creating my own theme, I had the confidence to take on some freelance work that came my way through the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/wp-columbus/">WordPress Columbus Meetup</a>. That was just over two years ago.</p><p class="question"><strong>So you just took off from there?</strong></p><p>When I realized that people would pay me to do that work it became even more exciting. At that time I had recently left my job as a physical therapist assistant to return to my previous profession as a mechanical engineer and join my husband in our engineering business. We eventually had enough of a lull in the business that I had the luxury of time to spend learning how to build websites. A number of projects came my way, so I started building custom WordPress sites for people.</p><p>I focused exclusively on WordPress for about six months before deciding I was ready to learn JavaScript. I tried various tutorials, but remember really taking off and starting to build little JavaScript apps after completing a <a href="http://www.lynda.com/">lynda.com</a> JavaScript course. Once I got into the logic of programming I was hooked and knew I wanted to be a developer. I signed up for <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and Java courses through <a href="http://www.oreillyschool.com/">O’Reilly School of Technology</a> and basically studied full-time for a number of months. My goal was to find a full-time position with a company, rather than continuing with freelance work.</p><p class="question"><strong>How did you decide what languages to learn?</strong></p><p>I see these languages as just being tools, right? In the beginning I was influenced by the people I met at meetups and what languages and libraries they recommended. My goal was to be employable, so that influenced my decision to study both Java and Rails.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-small media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><p class="quote-text">I’ve also always tried to focus on what I really need to know for the present.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve also always tried to focus on what I really need to know for the present. Sometimes that means abandoning what I’m working on. I dropped Java and Rails to focus on learning <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> for my job at <a href="http://pykl.com/">Pykl Studios</a>. When Pykl adopted Python, I started learning that. Now I’m focusing primarily on Python and Ruby for the work I’ll be doing at CoverMyMeds.</p><p class="question"><strong>Many of the higher level ideas would translate across languages, right?</strong></p><p>Yes, but there are definitely a lot of differences too. Ruby has a lot of good testing tools because their community is very big on testing. Data analysis is a big thing in Python, something I find exciting as an engineer, so I will continue to play with that even if I’m not using it at work. I have so much I want to learn and do and I don’t always have the time to do it [laughing].</p><p class="question"><strong>A common problem, right? When did you start at Pykl and what was your role there?</strong></p><p>A little over a year ago I was working at my computer and I got an email through the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ng-columbus/">AngularJS Meetup</a> that said that Pykl was looking for a junior developer. I wasn’t sure if I had enough experience, but I thought, “What the heck. I’ll apply.” So I immediately sent back an email and said, “Hey I’m interested in learning more about the job and here’s a link to my portfolio.” Then I opened up Google Analytics where you can…</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://pykl.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-pykl-studios-480by374-9fd148.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-pykl-studios-320by249-9fd148.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-pykl-studios-480by374-9fd148.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-pykl-studios-320by249-9fd148.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-pykl-studios-720by561-9fd148.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-pykl-studios-480by374-9fd148.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-pykl-studios-320by249-9fd148.jpg" alt="Pykl Studios." ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">A screenshot from <a href="http://pykl.com/" class="media-link">Pykl Studios</a>.</div></div><p class="question"><strong>…[Laughing] You can watch who is visiting your site?</strong></p><p>Yes, in real time. I watched as they clicked through my site and I was very excited. It was a good moment. They got back to me right away and I had a phone interview, where I was asked to code some basic exercises in JavaScript. I think I did FizzBuzz and a Fibonacci sequence. Fortunately, I had been practicing with those types of exercises through <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>.</p><p class="question"><strong>It can’t hurt, right?</strong></p><p>Especially because those exercises have become tests for developers. I’m not sure it’s the best measure of a developer because to me the overall body of work is more important.</p><p>Anyway, I passed the test and was asked to come in for an interview and spend a couple of hours coding a sample website. After that, I sat down with the team at Pykl and I answered questions about my code. They apparently liked what I did and extended an offer, which I was happy to take.</p><p class="question"><strong>You’ve just accepted a position with CoverMyMeds. How’d that come about?</strong></p><p>That has been a very recent development. About two and half weeks ago I went to lunch with a friend I know through Girl Develop It. She and another co-worker from CoverMyMeds had come to our monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/girldevelopitcbus/">Hack Night</a> and made an announcement that they were looking for Test Engineers. I think this position had been announced before at <a href="http://columbusrb.com/">Ruby Brigade</a>, but I hadn’t quite bitten yet, although I wanted to hear more. I told her this and she invited me to lunch. They have a chef there…</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="https://www.covermymeds.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-covermymeds-logo-480by79-56d774.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-covermymeds-logo-320by53-56d774.png"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-covermymeds-logo-480by79-56d774.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-covermymeds-logo-320by53-56d774.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-covermymeds-logo-612by101-56d774.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-covermymeds-logo-480by79-56d774.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-covermymeds-logo-320by53-56d774.png" alt="CoverMyMeds" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The logo for <a href="https://www.covermymeds.com/" class="media-link">CoverMyMeds</a>.</div></div><p class="question"><strong>…[Laughing] I am jealous!</strong></p><p>I wouldn’t work there just for that, but I’m really happy about that particular perk. So I went to lunch, met the team, and spoke with their test team leader. He described the work they do and I got excited because it sounded very interesting and challenging.</p><p class="question"><strong>So they are going to really put you to work then?</strong></p><p>I hope so. I thrive on challenges. As a developer I’ve been looking at things from a wholly different angle. I’ve been building things and hoping that they work. As a test engineer, I’ll now be trying to push things to break, in order to ensure that they don’t fail for the user. To do this I’ll be writing automated tests.</p><p>For the interview I had to do black box testing and they allowed me to use whatever framework I wanted, so I picked <a href="http://jnicklas.github.io/capybara/">Capybara</a>. I’m grateful that at Pykl I did similar testing, but with <a href="http://angular.github.io/protractor/">Protractor</a>, which is an AngularJS wrapper for <a href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">Selenium WebDriver</a>. So Capybara is the same type of framework, only in Ruby.</p><p class="question"><strong>What meetups do you attend? What was the impetus for going your first time? It can be daunting being the new person.</strong></p><p>I got started with the Columbus WordPress Meetup Group, which is a great group of people. I didn’t even realize there was such a thing as a meetup, but I stumbled across it as I was searching for information and thought I’d check it out.</p><p>That was the only meetup I went to for quite a while and I was pretty devoted to it. Eventually, as my skills grew, I was helping people at the meetup instead of being the person who’s there to ask for help. And I remember helping someone and it caught the attention of the two women who were sitting right in front of me.</p><p>They were active members of GDIC and invited me to come to their next meetup and asked if I’d like to help out as a teaching assistant. I started going to GDIC regularly and also helped with a number of their classes.</p><p>GDIC occasionally makes field trips to other meetup groups. This was how I made my first visits to the <a href="http://cbusjs.github.io/">JavaScript Meetup</a> and Columbus Ruby Brigade. I still attend those meetups regularly. I also go to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Central-Ohio-Python-Users-Group/">Central Ohio Python Users Group</a> regularly now and AngularJS when I can.</p><p>Now that I’ll be working at CoverMyMeds my emphasis on Angular will diminish. I only have so much time to focus on the things I really need to know for my job, so with my free time I’ve been studying Python and Ruby, but I’ll still keep learning JavaScript, since you can’t escape it.</p><p class="question"><strong>[Laughing] No, it’s where the web’s going.</strong></p><p>Right? People love to hate it. If you want to talk to the browser­ ­you need to speak JavaScript, right? It’s a necessary thing, so you need to learn to work with it and respect it for what it is, but don’t try to make it what it isn’t. I probably have an advantage in that I’ve always been interested in JavaScript, but it can be frustrating for a back­end developer who comes to it with different expectations.</p><p>When you start with JavaScript, you learn its quirks and you deal with them. Then when you begin learning Python or Ruby, you see the beauty of those languages and it’s a breath of fresh air. It’s almost easier, in some ways, to come at it from the frontend instead of the other way around. But I don’t think that just because you’ve always done one thing that you can’t learn to do another. It’s just opening yourself up to new ideas.</p><p class="question"><strong>My introduction to you was <a href="http://janmilosh.github.io/prerender-talk/">your talk</a> at the JavaScript Meetup about <a href="https://prerender.io/">Prerender.io</a> for Angular apps. Do you often speak at meetups? Any tips?</strong></p><p>[Laughing] Yeah I have tips. My first talk was at the Python Meetup and I gave a lightning talk. The Python Meetup is a small group and for their talks, whoever’s there, they discuss something they’re doing. So I thought, “You know, I used Python for some data manipulation for a map in <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> that I made.” I needed to pull data from an API and go out to the Google Geolocation API to get the longitude and latitude for some cities. Python worked really nicely for what I was doing. I had never spoken before but I thought, “What the heck?”</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://janmilosh.com/d3-weather-graph.html" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-d3-weather-graph-app-480by276-246a17.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-d3-weather-graph-app-320by184-246a17.png"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-d3-weather-graph-app-480by276-246a17.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-d3-weather-graph-app-320by184-246a17.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-d3-weather-graph-app-720by415-246a17.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-d3-weather-graph-app-480by276-246a17.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-d3-weather-graph-app-320by184-246a17.png" alt="Jan Milosh’s D3.js weather graph app." ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">One of Jan’s projects, a <a href="http://janmilosh.com/d3-weather-graph.html" class="media-link">D3.js weather graph</a> app.</div></div><p>It’s an informal group and that’s the perfect way. Just share something interesting that you’ve done. That’s all you really need to do.</p><p>I’ve since done a couple more talks at the Python Meetup and those are all easy and informal. I really recommend that you share what you’ve done, even in the smallest way. Just find a small meetup that’s hungry for people to talk and share something you’ve done. It’ll be an easy talk to give if it’s something you’re interested in.</p><p>More recently, I gave <a href="https://github.com/janmilosh/d3js-presentation">a talk on D3.js</a> at <a href="http://columbuscodecamp.com/">Code Camp</a>. It was a basic presentation, but I tried to make it interactive without making it tedious to set up. You could download the talk from GitHub and play with it, without having to load any dependencies, except you needed to run a server. One of my coworkers was sitting in the back of the room and he said that about half of the people were interacting with the code, so that was good.</p><p>The thing that I always tell myself is that I will never be as bad as the worst talk I've ever heard. Since I can’t even remember the worst talk I've heard, I bet no one else probably does either. Even if there’s a question that you don’t have an answer for, somebody else in the audience probably does and will help you out. Just remember that people are your friends out there.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-full"><p class="quote-text">Just find a small meetup that’s hungry for speakers and share something you’ve done. It’ll be an easy talk to give if it’s something you’re interested in.</p></blockquote><p class="question"><strong>So you are the Mentorship Program Coordinator for Girl Develop It Columbus. What does that entail?</strong></p><p>I see it as being a matchmaker. At one of the admin meetings I suggested that we create a program to help people find mentors. If you want to continue learning or get a job, it helps to have professional guidance.</p><p>I was fully prepared to volunteer to run the program because if you’re going to bring an idea forward, you had better be prepared to be the one to do it. Everyone else thought it was a worthwhile, so I said I would do it.</p><p>At the meeting I also mentioned that I wanted a mentor too. A more experienced developer sitting next to me at the meeting offered to be my mentor. I’ve found that lot of people are willing to help those less experienced than themselves. As a mentor, you learn by teaching and you can also get re-energized by the person you’re helping.</p><p>We have a form that we ask prospective mentors or mentees to fill out. I help put them together based on the mentor’s experience and what the mentee is hoping to learn. I suggest a minimum time commitment of about two hours per week for about a month. And past that it’s up to them to keep going if they would like. We also ask that the sessions take place over remote shared screens, something like <a href="https://www.join.me/">Join.me</a>, in a public place, or at our hack nights.</p><p class="question"><strong>Tell me about Girl Develop It Columbus. How big is it? When did it start?</strong></p><p>I believe our local chapter was started in 2011. We can be found <a href="http://www.meetup.com/girldevelopitcbus/">on Meetup.com</a>. Our major events are a hack night on the fourth Wednesday of each month and also Code and Coffee’s which can vary, but right now are falling on the second Monday of each month. There are usually about 10-20 people at our events, sometimes less at Code and Coffee. It can be a fairly intimate group.</p><p>We also have classes such as HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I recommend checking Meetup.com to see what's scheduled.</p><p>For our Hack Nights we meet at <a href="http://www.wildgoosecreative.com/">Wild Goose Creative</a> and CoverMyMeds is our sponsor. We’re very grateful for their support since they make it possible for us to meet there. It works out well given the size of our group, which is much smaller than other meetups.</p><p class="question"><strong>There are advantages to smaller groups, since you can’t hide in the back of the room. You’d probably get a lot more out of it.</strong></p><p>It’s more of an informal meeting. We typically don’t have presentations, but instead people come in with a problem, which we help them find a solution to. It’s a community of people helping each other with the goal being to promote women as developers. Also, we don’t care if you don’t want to make a career out of this. That’s OK. If you just want to learn how to make websites, that’s fine too.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/columbus" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-gdic-logo-480by392-4032c1.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-gdic-logo-320by261-4032c1.png"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-gdic-logo-480by392-4032c1.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-gdic-logo-320by261-4032c1.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-gdic-logo-720by588-4032c1.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-gdic-logo-480by392-4032c1.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-gdic-logo-320by261-4032c1.png" alt="Girl Develop It Columbus" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The logo for <a href="http://www.girldevelopit.com/chapters/columbus" class="media-link">Girl Develop It Columbus</a>.</div></div><p>We’ve had ladies come in who want to start a blog, so we’ll help them decide which platform to use. I have a background in WordPress, we also have a guy with a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a> background. We’ll recommend a tool that’s geared to what that person wants to do, to get that person going. We want to be a hub to let people branch out.</p><p>What we do isn’t an exclusive thing. We want to encourage women to infiltrate [laughing], to get out in the community, to join the meetups and involve themselves in other groups. That’s why we have our field trips to meetups, to show what’s out there. I imagine those groups don’t know what hit them! Suddenly there are women here, what are those things?!</p><p>I can’t count the number of times I’ve looked around and thought, “Yep, I’m the only woman here.” I went to engineering school and had classes where I was the only woman and I don’t really care. I enjoy what’s going on intellectually and when you share an interest with other people, then age, gender, and any other differences don’t really matter. The only thing that divides people is a lack of communication. When you speak the same language, suddenly you have common ground and there’s something you can talk about.</p><p class="question"><strong>Do you have any suggestions for women looking to get into web development?</strong></p><p>Yes, I have a lot of suggestions [laughing], although I don’t know if they’re always taken. The one thing that really helped me was when I discovered a podcast called <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">ShopTalk</a>, with Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert. Chris founded <a href="http://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks</a>, which is a leading blog about frontend development.</p><p class="question"><strong>My Google searches lead me there at least once a week.</strong></p><p>He’s always at the top of the results.</p><p>I eventually found this podcast and I’ve listened to every episode, which meant going back and listening to around fifty past episodes.</p><p>What really struck me was Chris saying, “Just Build Websites!” He’ll have people ask him, “What should I do to get better? I want to have a career in web development. What should I learn next?” His response is always, ”Just Build Websites!”</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://janmilosh.com/loan-and-savings-calculator.html" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-loan-calculator-app-480by240-412023.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-loan-calculator-app-320by160-412023.png"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-loan-calculator-app-480by240-412023.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-loan-calculator-app-320by160-412023.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-loan-calculator-app-720by361-412023.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-loan-calculator-app-480by240-412023.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-loan-calculator-app-320by160-412023.png" alt="Jan Milosh’s loan and savings calculator." ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">Another of Jan’s projects, a <a href="http://janmilosh.com/loan-and-savings-calculator.html" class="media-link">loan and savings calculator</a> app.</div></div><p>I took that to heart and I just kept building websites. Sometimes they were entire websites or little JavaScript applications, like a mortgage calculator or a color palette creator. All of those early projects are still in my portfolio and I am proud of them, even though I know that when you look at the JavaScript, you’ll go “What!?” But that doesn’t matter since they work and it was the best I could do at the time with what I knew. I learned from each of those projects and I took what I learned and I did better the next time, to the point of building myself a career.</p><p>When I started I was just trying to understand how HTML works, so I did tutorials, but eventually you need to jump off the tutorial and build something that’s just yours. If you can’t think of something to do, then go to someone else’s website, copy their basic layout, and alter it to make it your own.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-small media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><p class="quote-text">I learned from each of those projects and I took what I learned and I did better the next time, to the point of building myself a career.</p></blockquote><p>When you’re building your first site, you’re going to struggle for days. Once you’ve built it, you’ll then have that as a base for the next thing you build. But if you’ve never done that first site, then you’re not going to advance. You really need to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript too, before you move on to building more advanced things.</p><p>Whenever I discovered something cool I would try to build it, but I would limit the number of new things to a reasonable amount. There was always something that I was trying to learn, which I would incorporate into my project. That’s why I have a lot of projects, although I was spending too much time on it, like no work-life balance. As I’ve been progressing I am trying to have a better balance between work and life, but it’s not easy to get into this.</p><p class="question"><strong>There’s always a lot to learn, which can be daunting. How were you able to carve out the time?</strong></p><p>I’m at a point in my life where I have the time. My kids are adults and I can’t imagine doing this earlier in my life because I need to have an incredible amount of focus to do things. I tend to put my whole being into what I’m doing and that’s what happened after I started on this path. You have to find the space and the time if you want to get into development. I don’t know if there’s any way around that.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://janmilosh.com/color-palette-creator-web-applicatin.html" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-color-palette-app-480by297-b388eb.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-color-palette-app-320by198-b388eb.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-color-palette-app-480by297-b388eb.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-color-palette-app-320by198-b388eb.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-color-palette-app-720by445-b388eb.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-color-palette-app-480by297-b388eb.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/04-jan-milosh-screenshot-color-palette-app-320by198-b388eb.jpg" alt="Jan Milosh’s color palette creator." ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">One of Jan’s projects, a <a href="http://janmilosh.com/color-palette-creator-web-applicatin.html" class="media-link">color palette creator</a> app.</div></div><p class="question"><strong>I have coworkers who joke that their side projects are their kids because they literally have no time for development outside of work.</strong></p><p>That’s how it should be, really. When you have little kids, or even teenagers, they take up so much of your time. There’s something to do every night of the week. Good luck fitting dinner in. Your whole life revolves around your kids, and it’s really a luxury to be able to spend time with them, though it can be frustrating when you want to do your own thing too.</p><p>I have absolutely no regrets about that period of my life. I interrupted my career as an engineer to stay home with my kids. My husband traveled a lot with his work, so in order to have a sane family life, we decided that I’d be the one to stay home. And I’m glad that I did. The kids have exceeded my dreams of how they’d turn out. We have a good relationship and that comes from spending the time with them.</p><p class="question"><strong>What’s your family’s perception of your new career?</strong></p><p>After I built the first website for our business, which is for my husband’s engineering work, I was always on my computer, learning to build things. I basically had a full-time, eighteen-hour-a-day hobby which was a little hard to take because I wasn’t producing anything for the family.</p><p>But then I got my first freelance job and suddenly I was able to contribute. I would sit at the computer and work and my husband would sit a plate of food in front of me, so that I could eat and keep working. He has been extremely supportive in helping me to do this. Before it became an actual vocation, where I could earn some income, it did look a lot more like a dream.</p><p>Now, I’d say that he’s very happy I found this. I still spend a lot of my free time working at it, although the kids are gone and my husband is self-employed, so he’s often working in the evenings too. So, I guess it works out. I’d say there’s very good support. He does a lot of the cooking and grocery shopping because I have been very busy for a couple years now. I greatly appreciate that. He’s a great guy.</p><p class="question"><strong>What are your interests outside of web development?</strong></p><p>[Laughing] Like those things I used to do before? A couple of days ago I went out and bought a new sound system because my old stereo is thirty years old and really didn’t work. Last night I put on some music, took out my flute, and I actually played along and jammed a bit. Music was my original passion and it’s what I wanted to do when I grew up, but I found that it wasn’t a very good way to make a living, so I ended up being an engineer. I still played music for years, and when my kids were little, I started seriously studying piano.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-full"><p class="quote-text">It’s practice. Music is good training for being a developer because what it takes is devoted, regular practice. That’s what I’ve done and will continue to do.</p></blockquote><p>I would have loved to have been a performer, but it’s a very hard thing to do. I practiced four hours a day when I was really studying piano. I’ve played five different instruments that I’ve actually performed with: saxophone, flute, piano, mountain dulcimer, and guitar. Now if I want to just pick up an instrument and play it for fun, I can do that. I’m not thinking in terms of being a performer or in a band anymore. I like playing just for the joy of it and plan to spend more time doing that.</p><p>It’s fun to play along with music. With the piano you can just sit down and play it, but with the flute and saxophone it’s nice to have music to play along with. I’ve concluded that the only way to learn is to just play along and accept the fact you’re going to be really bad for a long time.</p><p class="question"><strong>That’s true with anything new you learn, right? It’s just like making websites.</strong></p><p>It’s practice. Music is good training for being a developer because what it takes is devoted, regular practice. That’s what I’ve done and will continue to do.</p><p class="question"><strong>What are your goals for the next year?</strong></p><p>My goal is to be the best test engineer that I can possibly be. I have personal goals too. Whenever there’s a change, it’s a good time to switch up your habits. At CoverMyMeds, I’ll have a healthy lunch prepared for me every day and I won’t have a cupcake place a block away from work, so I will hopefully improve my diet. Being a developer is not the best thing for your physical being.</p><p class="question"><strong>We do sit all day.</strong></p><p>They have standing desks at CoverMyMeds, so I won’t have to sit all day. I was also told there’s a gym in the building, so I look forward to that. I became a physical therapist assistant when my kids were teenagers, so health and fitness are two things that are important to me. I’ve definitely shoved that aside in my pursuit to become a developer. I’ve realized that long term, it’s not good to have that unhealthy mindset, so I’ll be going to the gym and eating better. I’ll also be getting back into yoga, which is another interest of mine.</p><br><hr><p>You’ve just read about <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/jan-milosh/">Jan Milosh</a></strong> on <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/">Webworke.rs</a></strong>, a website about folks who make websites in Columbus, OH.</p><p>For updates, follow us on <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Webworkers614">Facebook</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://plus.google.com/+Webworkers614/">Google+</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/webworkers">LinkedIn</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://Webworkers614.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Webworkers614">Twitter</a></strong>.</p>

Who’s your ideal client?</strong></p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> If you were to ask me five months ago, I would have said, “I’m a freelancer.” We’re only now starting to embrace the idea that we’re a boutique digital agency. Our business is to help other businesses increase their revenue, efficiency, and awareness through internet marketing, whether that’s via their website, email marketing or social media.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><picture><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-portrait-480by480-9e1697.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-portrait-320by320-9e1697.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-portrait-480by480-9e1697.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-portrait-320by320-9e1697.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-portrait-512by512-9e1697.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-portrait-480by480-9e1697.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-portrait-320by320-9e1697.jpg" alt="Angie Meeker" ></picture><div class="media-caption">Angie Meeker is the Chief Strategy Officer at <a href="http://angiemeekerdesigns.com/" class="media-link">Angie Meeker Designs</a>, a boutique digital agency.</div></div><p>As for our ideal client, we just started reading through <a href="http://www.bookyourselfsolid.com/">“Book Yourself Solid”</a> by Michael Port, which is a book that helps you decide who your ideal client is. A few days ago I would have said that our ideal client is any business or nonprofit that has good work to do and has the money to pay us, but that’s not really true. We have realized that the businesses we really want to be working with are ones that are in the travel industry. That would give us the opportunity to work with local businesses across the country. That feels like a really specific niche now that I say it, but that’s where we want to be heading.</p><p>Previously we’ve mostly worked with small business and nonprofits. Although in the past six months our clients have become larger and larger, which is where we are now.</p><p class="question"><strong>What are the services that you are most excited about providing?</strong></p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> I get most excited about helping our clients with their content marketing because that’s what drives the most traffic to their site. It also helps them build the best relationships with their customers.</p><p>When we first started, we were just selling websites. We said, “We’ll build it. Whatever you need, we’ll build it.” And we trusted the client to know what they needed, which wasn’t always in the client’s best interest. We’ve transitioned to asking, “What do you need this work to return for you?,” because there’s got to be a hard number that they’re working towards. It may be revenue or any other goal that can be measured. We want to report back to say, “Due to our work, we’ve returned back to you two or three times your investment with us based on these measurements.” That moves the discussion away from cost and towards the true value of our services.</p><p>We want to work with clients who are willing to tell us, “Here’s where our business is now and here’s where we want it to be. What strategies can we put in place to get us there?” Instead of just, “I think I need a website,” or, “I think I need to be active on social networks.” The content marketing is the primary goal and driver of value, while our WordPress development services are truthfully just a really great tool for sharing that information and reaching that goal.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-full"><p class="quote-text">The content marketing is the primary goal and driver of value, while our WordPress development services are truthfully just a really great tool for sharing that information and reaching that goal.</p></blockquote><p class="question"><strong>Ultimately you want to provide the services that help your clients achieve their goals, even if your clients mistake the means for the ends. You’re the expert, even though some clients may not always recognize that.</strong></p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> The difference between a client whose goal is only a website is that those people aren’t looking for an expert. They’ve already found the solution and it’s just a website, so they think that they’re good to go.</p><p>What we really want is someone who tells us their goals and asks, “How can you help us? What do you have to offer?” And those are the clients that we’re most willing to partner with and provide our services to. Dealing with clients who have already decided what they want, when they’re mistaken about it, are often very difficult to work with. We’ve had a few of those.</p><p class="question"><strong>So Bob recently joined full time? Quit his job and went all in with Angie Meeker Designs, right?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> I felt like he didn’t care for his job in the first place and it’s okay to say that. There were aspects of it that he liked and aspects that he didn’t.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> It’s fair to say that we made a judgement based on where I could make the most impact and money. I was in the position of working for a nonprofit and not being very well compensated for my work, so it wasn’t as difficult a decision as it might have been otherwise.</p><p>Angie and I had been discussing the future of the agency. She can of course keep doing what she’s been doing, but there’s a limit to what she can do herself. If we want to take the business further we need to analyze our processes, so that getting a client takes less time and working through a project becomes more efficient. Angie’s one person so she can’t necessarily give the one-on-one contact that some of our clients need.</p><p>One example of this is that Angie does the work, but when she’s busy it’s hard to communicate everything that’s being done to a client. So some clients get worried and frequently ask for updates, whether it’s a text, an email, or a phone call. Sometimes we even get all three over the course of a day. That makes it hard for her to focus on the task at hand, so we’re working on having systems in place to alleviate that.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> Bob’s background is in public administration and that’s what he’s spent his career doing. He not only helps our own business, but now assists our our clients with their processes in a way that’s different than most digital agencies are able to do. We’re now able to make that connection between the design, marketing, and the business operations, which is very exciting to me.</p><p class="question"><strong>Not only are your skill sets complimentary, but he also frees you up to do more of what you’re specialized in and like to do.</strong></p><p>Absolutely. We’re just getting into that. He’s been onboard since March, but honestly over the summer he spent most of his time with our daughter Nila, which is fantastic since it’s been a long time since he’s been able to spend that much time with her.</p><p>Now that school has started, we’re looking at our systems to make everything more efficient. For so long I’ve done everything: marketing, selling, designing, building, follow up, maintenance, all of it. If we’re going to grow we need to put systems in place so that some of the work can be passed off. The next project will probably be the first one where we actually hire a designer and a developer instead of having me do that work, which is a big deal for us as a company.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://angiemeekerdesigns.com/marketing-business-using-wordpress/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordpress-marketing-480by413-7ad825.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordpress-marketing-320by275-7ad825.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordpress-marketing-480by413-7ad825.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordpress-marketing-320by275-7ad825.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordpress-marketing-512by440-7ad825.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordpress-marketing-480by413-7ad825.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordpress-marketing-320by275-7ad825.jpg" alt="Marketing Your Business Using WordPress" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">One of Angie’s full day workshops, <a href="http://angiemeekerdesigns.com/marketing-business-using-wordpress/" class="media-link">Marketing Your Business Using WordPress</a>.</div></div><p class="question"><strong>How long have you been working as Angie Meeker Designs?</strong></p><p>I’ve been doing it since 2008, although in the past year and a half I can say, “Wow, this is a business,” instead of a very profitable hobby.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> The date I use is August, 2008.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> Yeah. That’s when we started. I don’t know why you said August.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> Because that’s an accurate date, that’s when you had your first job.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> I used to be a youth pastor and right after we got married we moved to Northern Iraq, in Kurdistan, where Bob was working. When we came back, I decided I didn’t want to work in the church anymore. So, I asked myself, “What skills do I have from working in the church?” I had some website skills that I learned on the job, of course looking back I’m embarrassed…</p><p class="question"><strong>Hey all of us have terrible websites in our past.</strong></p><p>So website work is what I started doing to make a little money. Our daughter was less than a year old, so I wanted to be home with her. At the time I thought, “I’ll just figure out how to advertise on Craigslist and I’ll get some clients that way.” And I did. The first site I did was for $200 and I thought that was a big deal! It was for a barbecue company that’s still around and they still have that same website, which does exactly what they need it to do, although perhaps I should approach them about a redesign soon.</p><p class="question"><strong>You’re a lot more skilled now, so I bet you could charge more than $200!</strong></p><p>Hopefully they would give me barbecue again too!</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> At first Angie did a lot of bartering for her work, so we got all sorts of cool stuff.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> We got catering and even a garden installed in our backyard, although we don’t do that anymore…</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> …unless somebody had something really good.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> It would need to be something really good because we don’t do that anymore. Anyway, that’s what we did. I’ve only ever used WordPress, which put us on the path that we’re on now. I went to <a href="http://columbus.wordcamp.org">WordCamp Columbus</a> in 2009 and thought, “Oh my gosh, look at all this cool stuff I can do.”</p><p class="question"><strong>So you’ve really grown a lot with WordPress.</strong></p><p>I have, even though I’m not a developer. I still can’t build anything from scratch. You know what I mean? But I don’t have to.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-small media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><p class="quote-text">I went to WordCamp Columbus in 2009 and thought, “Oh my gosh, look at all this cool stuff I can do.</p></blockquote><p class="question"><strong>You don’t need to.</strong></p><p>Most clients don’t care if you can, at least not the clients that I work with. They don’t care that it’s WordPress or that it wasn’t hand coded. They only want to be able to update it themselves, with the confidence that it works and helps them reach their goals.</p><p class="question"><strong>How did you become involved with the WordPress meetups?</strong></p><p>I organized the 2011 WordCamp in Columbus after the previous organizers bowed out. I didn’t want it to go away because it had been so valuable to me. I had experience in event planning from my work with the church, so I volunteered to organize it and thought, “If it flops, so what?” At least I tried to keep it going. The previous year it wasn’t really focused on WordPress, so I wanted to fix that and keep it only about WordPress.</p><p><a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/">The WordPress Foundation</a> would prefer that a city not have a WordCamp unless a local meetup already exists. Columbus didn’t have one, so we inadvertently did it backwards. After that first WordCamp we started the meetup and I’ve just kept doing it since then. It’s always been interesting since we have novices, developers, designers, and business owners who come. It’s really a diverse group, although we’re still working on making it welcoming and interesting to as many people as possible.</p><div class="media--left"><a href="http://columbus.wordcamp.org/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordcamp-columbus-184by185-8632bc.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordcamp-columbus-184by185-8632bc.png"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordcamp-columbus-184by185-8632bc.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordcamp-columbus-184by185-8632bc.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordcamp-columbus-184by185-8632bc.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordcamp-columbus-184by185-8632bc.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-wordcamp-columbus-184by185-8632bc.png" alt="WordCamp Columbus" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The logo for last year’s <a href="http://columbus.wordcamp.org/" class="media-link">WordCamp Columbus</a>.</div></div><p>Also, back to WordCamp, the past couple years it’s just been Bob and me, although <a href="https://twitter.com/arcware">Dave</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathandavis">John</a> helped one year too. This was the first year that I had to find speakers for both days of camp. It’s a risk to the event if I’m the only one organizing it, so after this year, I asked for help from the Foundation to help cover roles and organize speakers. People responded overwhelmingly well to it, so I now have help so that I’m not trying to doing everything.</p><p class="question"><strong>It must be a lot of work to organize and run a WordCamp.</strong></p><p>It will be better next year than what it was this year because it’s got all these great people involved with it, who are excited about it. WordCamp is one of my favorite things that I do, so I am looking forward to it.</p><p class="question"><strong>Tell me about <a href="http://yourcrimesite.com/">Your Crime Site</a>.</strong></p><p>One of our clients is the <a href="http://stopcrime.org/">Central Ohio Crime Stoppers</a>, for whom we developed a website several years ago. After their site debuted they started to get phone calls from other Crime Stopper organizations that wanted a similar site. This was right after I learned about WordPress Multisite, which was exactly what I needed to start spinning off websites.</p><p>Basically, we host the crime sites and ensure that they’re kept up-to-date. Either the client manages their content or we add and update it for them, for a fee. We also offer event registration and management options.</p><p>Our one big feature that distinguishes us from other competitors in the crime site space is that we put every crime on its own page, so it can have a unique URL. It’s much easier for visitors to search the site and pass around the links, which helps with the ultimate goal of showcasing the faces of the criminals, so they can be captured.</p><p>It’s a nice side project, although we go back and forth between wanting to focus on it and wanting to kill it.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> What’s funny is that one of us will say, “I think it’s time we need to find someone else to manage this.” And then we’ll change our minds and say, “No, look at all potential it has!” And then time will pass and the other person will say, “I think we’re done here,” but by then the other one of us will reply, “No, there’s still more opportunity!”</p><p>It has a lot of potential for Crime Stoppers and for us.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> It has. It’s something that we don’t take advantage of.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://yourcrimesite.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-your-crime-site-480by374-b1919c.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-your-crime-site-320by249-b1919c.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-your-crime-site-480by374-b1919c.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-your-crime-site-320by249-b1919c.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-your-crime-site-720by561-b1919c.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-your-crime-site-480by374-b1919c.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-your-crime-site-320by249-b1919c.jpg" alt="Your Crime Site" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The website for <a href="http://yourcrimesite.com/" class="media-link">Your Crime Site</a>.</div></div><p class="question"><strong>So it comes down to what’s the best use of your time? That’s probably constantly in </strong>your thoughts.</p><p>It is, yeah. The thing about Your Crime Site is that it’s this whole little ecosystem that would allow me to do all the things that I really like to do. I like teaching, so it’s an opportunity for me to help this entire little niche to learn how they can better market themselves online. But at the same time, it doesn’t yet meet all the criteria of what we really want to do. We haven’t killed it yet because it’s still doing what it needs to do for the couple of organizations that have it. It’ll stick around for a while more, I think.</p><p class="question"><strong>Cool. What’s the Eight Hour Business Makeover?</strong></p><p>Unfortunately that’s a project that’s been killed. I think it’s a really great idea and I had good feedback for it, but it’s just not a good fit for the businesses that would actually need the lessons contained within it. It was meant to be was an introduction to the pillars of internet marketing, to see how each area is connected. The participants would receive a workbook with exercises so that they could begin executing in each area of study. The problem was that the work involved would require more time, and assistance, than could be fit into a one or two day conference.</p><p>I’ve thought about making it an online course, so that it’s not crammed into such a short period of time. But the businesses that I’ve worked with don’t yet understand how to use those, or aren’t willing to do the work to put themselves through each one of those areas. So I decided the course work isn’t a good match for the client. I let the domain expire, although killing a project doesn’t mean that you can’t come back to it. </p><p class="question"><strong>Tell me about the Freelancers Conference.</strong></p><p>I’m always learning new things from running my business, which I make sure to share with others. As a result, I often have people coming up to me who ask, “When are you going to do a conference that helps us learn everything you know about contracts, onboarding, pricing, or even how to pick clients?” It has happened enough times that I finally decided that we’re going to do it.</p><p>So, next March we’re going to put on the Freelancers Conference, which will be focused on all the aforementioned topics and more. It won’t be specific to the WordPress community, since all sorts of small business people need to learn how to position themselves in their respective markets. We’ve asked the community what they want to learn about and now we’re finding the best speakers to cover those topics. I’m really excited about it. It will be a nonprofit event, the tickets will be affordable, and it will be held over two days.</p><p>I’m telling the speakers, “Don’t just bring an inspirational message about pricing or some talk about how you grew your team.” I want them to bring something more practical, something that our attendees can leave with, which will help them take the next step in their careers. It will be almost a workshop since it will be so hands-on. As soon as I mentioned it, I had people saying, “Let me know if I can help. I want to come speak. I’ll bring my team in to help.”</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://angiemeekerdesigns.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-angie-meeker-designs-480by374-976d12.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-angie-meeker-designs-320by249-976d12.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-angie-meeker-designs-480by374-976d12.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-angie-meeker-designs-320by249-976d12.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-angie-meeker-designs-720by561-976d12.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-angie-meeker-designs-480by374-976d12.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-screenshot-angie-meeker-designs-320by249-976d12.jpg" alt="Angie Meeker Designs" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The website for <a href="http://angiemeekerdesigns.com/" class="media-link">Angie Meeker Designs</a>.</div></div><p class="question"><strong>What’s a typical work day for you?</strong></p><p>We get up and take our daughter to school, so we don’t get back from that until about 9:30 AM. After that we start our work day. We don’t have a particular structure to our day, but we work until 2:30 to 3:00 PM and then we pick Nila up. And then I try really hard to stop working until she goes to bed, which is around 8:00 PM. In the past we would go pick Nila up from school and then I would go straight back to work until dinner, after which we would put her to bed and I’d still be working. It was just awful.</p><p class="question"><strong>So you’re trying for a better work and life balance?</strong></p><p>Exactly that. From 9:30 AM until 3:00 PM is not a very long time. A lot of freelancers think, “Oh, I’m going to work 40 hours a week for myself,” but that’s not true, at least in billable hours. The reality is that you probably have about 20 hours of the week when you’re doing work that directly relates to a client project. We’ve obviously moved away from this, but work that I could bill a client for, instead of work where I’m researching or doing administration. As we’ve learned to price our work better, it’s freed up a little bit of time.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yeah we don’t have typical work days. Angie works every day from when Nila leaves for school, until she gets back home. Once Nila goes to bed, Angie is often back working.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> Not every night.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> But when you do it’s until 10:00 PM. And then there’s weekends…</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> No, I don’t work through the weekends anymore.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yes, you do.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> No, I don’t.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> Yeah, but I’m trying not to do that anymore. On Tuesday afternoon we go to Nila’s school and do a reading group because the kids really need the help. If anyone reading this wants to help, let us know.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> If you’re out there, reading this.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> On Friday at noon I meet with a group of folks online for a business mastermind. That’s really the only structure to our week at this point.</p><p class="question"><strong>Do you work at home?</strong></p><p>Sometimes if I really need to get work done, I’ll go somewhere else, but mostly I just work at home. Bob has an office upstairs and I have one downstairs. I know there are benefits to coworking, but at the same time I don’t want to spend the money on the space. Even if we were a small agency, I wouldn’t want us to move into a space. Instead I’d want us to be working online, from wherever we wanted to work. It’s just us, so we work from home.</p><p class="question"><strong>How do you spend your free time?</strong></p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> We spend it with Nila.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> Yeah, although unfortunately my one hobby has become binge watching television, when I’m not with Nila or doing work.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> He does, not me. I’m trying to introduce Nila to things that she otherwise wouldn’t be introduced to. Like going fishing.</p><p class="question"><strong>How’d that go? I saw your tweet about that.</strong></p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> It was fun. We fell in the river.</p><p class="question"><strong>Which river?</strong></p><p>The Scioto.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> So, not me. Bob and Nila.</p><p class="question"><strong>You’re here now, which is good.</strong></p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> Right. We survived.</p><p class="question"><strong>You didn’t drift down into the Ohio.</strong></p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> I was on the dock and they were on the ramp, which was covered in algae. Nila slipped and then Bob slipped, so I then turn around and they’re both yelling, “We’re gonna die!” They didn’t, but for a moment they really had me. They couldn’t stand up for awhile because it was so slippery.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> I would like to say two things. One, I never wanted to go to the boat dock in the first place. I said it was a bad idea.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> He did.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> And I tried everything to get us to go somewhere else. Secondly, we had been playing and Nila slid in and couldn’t get out because it was so slick. Angie thinks it’s funny because she didn’t see Nila’s face when she realized that she couldn’t get up, so she was sliding into the river. I had to grab her. I knew that I could swim and I’d be fine, but I also realized that I couldn’t stand up either because it was too slippery. This all happened in the space of several seconds. Angie thinks it’s funny because she wasn’t traumatized like I was.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> Well, also, Bob’s a city kid. So it was humorous to me. He didn’t want to go in the first place, but we went and then he falls in the river. It was funny. Sort of.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><picture><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-family-480by480-c4ad9b.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-family-320by320-c4ad9b.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-family-480by480-c4ad9b.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-family-320by320-c4ad9b.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-family-626by626-c4ad9b.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-family-480by480-c4ad9b.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/03-angie-meeker-family-320by320-c4ad9b.jpg" alt="The Meekers" ></picture><div class="media-caption">Work and life balance for the Meekers.</div></div><p class="question"><strong>Did you catch any fish?</strong></p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> Yeah, we went in the late afternoon and our side of the river was too sunny. All the fish were on the other side. Nila still had fun, which was the point.</p><p>Most weekends we’re doing something together because we’re really strict about her bedtime. I know it sounds weird in response to this question. We’ve always put her to bed around 7:30 PM, which is early, so by the time we’re done with homework, make dinner, and put her to bed, the night’s over.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> And neither one of us is very crafty to take up a craft.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> In this part you can just write, “boring.” Anyway... </p><p class="question"><strong>What about your goals for the remainder of this year?</strong></p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> My goal is to have another $35,000 in revenue before the end of this year. A less tangible goal is to position ourselves so that next year we’re able to work with more of our ideal clients. This represents a huge shift in how we’re marketing ourselves, so we need to figure out how to reach these businesses. The other goal of mine is to really knock the Freelancers Conference out of the park because I’d like to do more events like that.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> My goal is to have all our new systems identified, mapped out, and working, which I don’t think will take until the end of the year.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> I think it will.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> It might.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> I haven’t needed that sort of stuff yet, but we need to get them in place or we won’t be able to grow beyond where we are right now.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> I want a client from the Caribbean by the end of the year.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> There you go, go do it, Bob.</p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> That’s what we call a goal.</p><p class="question"><strong>You never know, right?</strong></p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> If we can get to one of the French speaking islands in the Caribbean, then we can bring Nila, since she’s learning French at school. We’ll go for practice, so it’s not just for my own enjoyment.</p><p>All you need is one client. Do a good job and then with word of mouth referrals...</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> Yeah that’s true. I had someone email me a couple months ago and ask me the ways that I’ve advertised our business. And I responded that we hadn’t done any advertising at all. </p><p class="question"><strong>That speaks really well for the work you do.</strong></p><p><strong>Bob:</strong> I think so.</p><p><strong>Angie:</strong> I hope so.

The goal was to form a sort of trade association that would provide things like back office support (things like getting better deals on health insurance) and to help support editorial projects and enable members to collaborate better.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><picture><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-portrait-480by480-39118a.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-portrait-320by320-39118a.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-portrait-480by480-39118a.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-portrait-320by320-39118a.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-portrait-500by500-39118a.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-portrait-480by480-39118a.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-portrait-320by320-39118a.jpg" alt="Adam Schweigert" ></picture><div class="media-caption">Adam Schweigert is Senior Director of Product &amp; Technology at <a href="http://investigativenewsnetwork.org/" class="media-link">Investigative News Network</a>.</div></div><p>At the time there were around twenty members, but now it’s up to around one hundred. In addition to the back office services, we now provide technology services and also do a lot of training, mostly focused on basic business skills. A lot of people who start nonprofits often come from a journalism background and may not have as much of a background in business, technology, and all of the associated skills you need to run an effective news organization.</p><p>So we try to fill in those gaps, and especially technology-wise, which is my role, to look at the things that we can do to support the entire network. Things that make sense at that larger scale, such as building our Largo WordPress platform, finding deals on software, and developing tools that will be widely applicable. It would cost a fortune for each member to build their own tools and start from scratch to develop a website, but we can build once and then help everyone to use and adapt the tools we build.</p><p>So that’s why building <a href="http://largoproject.org/">Project Largo</a>, our WordPress framework, makes a lot of sense. Rather than having every single member start from scratch with a different CMS, a unique theme, and separate hosting, we bundle those things to save our members time and money. Especially for things like hosting, it’s much more effective for us to pay for high end hosting for the entire network than for everyone to purchase that on their own.</p><p>The members can instead spend the money they save on that last ten percent of stuff that’s unique to their organization. It allows them more flexibility to actually innovate, rather than on simply getting to the starting line. We always tell members that,“We’ll host your site, give you a framework to customize, and provide training and support, but that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t invest the money you save by spending it on other things.”</p><blockquote class="quote quote-small media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><p class="quote-text">The Investigative News Network helps nonprofit news organizations produce and distribute stories with impact, achieve cost efficiencies by pooling resources and develop new revenue streams to become sustainable businesses.</p><cite class="citation-small"><a href="http://investigativenewsnetwork.org/about/" class="citation-small--link">About INN</a></cite></blockquote><p>Even though there’s a cost savings, I would rather see our members reinvest their savings to experiment, to learn more about what’s most effective for their audience, because INN’s members are not monolithic. There’s a good diversity of sizes and focuses, so we can’t make a framework that would be the ideal solution for every member. I’d rather they spend the money they save on custom add-ons, design, and experimenting with different content approaches to see what’s most effective for them.</p><p class="question"><strong>How many staff members make up INN? How many on the technology side?</strong></p><p>The staff is up to eight or nine employees and then we have various consultants, contractors, interns, and other vendors. The tech team as of May was only me and a number of outside contractors, but we’re now building <a href="http://nerds.investigativenewsnetwork.org/">a team inside INN</a> because it makes more sense with the projects we have.</p><p>We were having a hard time finding contractors who had the same long term vision that we do. There’s also a lot of ongoing support requests from our members to customize or build additional functionality for our Largo framework. As an in-house product team, we’re just going to know the members and the framework so much better, so we’ll be able to do the work faster and cheaper.</p><p>As long as we have the demand and funding, I’m pretty keen on bringing more of that work back in-house. We’re now two people and will be adding a third soon, probably in the next couple of weeks. We still have some outside contractors and usually an intern or two.</p><p>We’re focused on growing the team by building upon a co-op model, where if members need support or custom work, we’ll do it for them, much like a small agency would. The members will pay us a very reasonable, subsidized rate to do the work, and we’ll use that money to offset some of our costs. This will then allow us to scale in an organic way to best address member needs as they change and evolve.</p><p class="question"><strong>What’s the size and composition of your ideal team?</strong></p><p>There’s only so big a size that would make sense for us. I think a team of five or six, at least as the core team may be ideal for building something like Largo. A team of five or six is fine and is probably as large as you would actually want to avoid becoming too big and having all the associated problems that come along with that.</p><p>I don’t think we’ll ever be a giant team, but we’ll probably continue to grow as INN’s membership grows. But there are only going to be so many nonprofit news organizations in the U.S., so there’s a ceiling to our growth. There’s also only so much money coming into the sector, even as our members become more financially stable, so that’s another potential limiting factor.</p><p class="question"><strong>Where does funding come from for INN?</strong></p><p>Today, INN is almost entirely funded by foundations, so we get grants, and some of those are for general operating expenses that aren’t restricted to any project, so we have some leeway in how we spend that. But some grants are focused on a particular project.</p><p>We’re now looking to diversify our revenue streams with things like our paid consulting program so that we’re less reliant on the foundation money. Fortunately, INN has really identified a need that a lot of foundations buy into, but at the same time foundations can change their priorities. Our funding has actually been pretty good and we’re funded by some of the larger, more stable foundations, which is great, but it still never hurts to have diversity in our revenue streams.</p><p class="question"><strong>Have you officially started the co-op model? What’s been the reaction from the members. Is this a hard sell?</strong></p><p>No, it’s actually been a really easy sell. We just announced it a month ago and this was after talking to a number of members. I make my decisions by listening to our membership and understanding what their unmet needs are. A lot of members are small enough that they don’t have a full time technology person on their staff, so they often hire contractors to fill in the gaps.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://wisconsinwatch.org/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-wisconsin-watch-480by374-81d2ed.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-wisconsin-watch-320by249-81d2ed.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-wisconsin-watch-480by374-81d2ed.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-wisconsin-watch-320by249-81d2ed.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-wisconsin-watch-720by561-81d2ed.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-wisconsin-watch-480by374-81d2ed.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-wisconsin-watch-320by249-81d2ed.jpg" alt="Wisconsin Watch" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The website for <a href="http://wisconsinwatch.org/" class="media-link">Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism</a>.</div></div><p>They fall into the same problem we’ve fallen into from time to time, where contractors aren’t necessarily well-aligned with their mission. The organizations lurch from project to project and don’t have that continuity in vision between their projects. The members also pay market rates for freelance technology help, which is often pretty expensive for a non-profit.</p><p>I approached them and asked, “What if we had a team that you could hire to do that development or support work, at a reduced rate, at least until you’re able to hire a full-time person?” There were enough members who thought that was a great idea that would be super helpful for them. So we’re figuring out how to make that happen.</p><p>There are also a lot of nonprofits that still don’t understand why it’s unreasonable to expect to pay a developer $30,000 a year. They might be able to find a really nice person right out of school, someone who would be willing to spend a couple of years working for them, or it’s someone who’s already made their money, right? [laughing]</p><p>But if you’re looking to pay a competitive salary and recruit top talent then that’s a lot harder to do. That’s something that INN is lucky to be able to do. If I can subsidize that cost with a little bit of foundation money, that’s why we can charge members around $50 an hour, which is very affordable for the quality of work you’ll get.</p><p class="question"><strong>One of the tools that you provide to your members is the Project Largo, which is what?</strong></p><p>It’s a <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> framework, which is composed of an open source parent theme with associated plugins, that you can further customize. We’re aiming to give members basically a website in a box.</p><p>We build on all of the great things that WordPress is known for, particularly ease of use, so you can activate the theme, do the initial configuration, and in an hour you have a running website. The theme itself is built on a solid codebase that follows best practices. There’s metadata that’s associated with the content, which handles a lot of SEO and social media issues without adding additional plugins. For members we also host many of the sites, so we cover the cost of high end hosting, which includes all the security, performance optimization, and software updates. It’s a platform for members and an open source project too, so you can take it and modify it however you choose.</p><p class="question"><strong>Do you have any member organizations that use the framework to its full potential?</strong></p><p>[laughing] This is always a tough question. I think we’re getting there. There’s a lot we have a lot to do in regards to training and support to help organizations understand everything that’s available because there’s a lot of stuff that’s still not as obvious as I’d like it to be.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://largoproject.org/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-largo-project-logo-480by480-12395a.png" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-largo-project-logo-320by320-12395a.png"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-largo-project-logo-480by480-12395a.png" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-largo-project-logo-320by320-12395a.png" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-largo-project-logo-720by720-12395a.png" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-largo-project-logo-480by480-12395a.png" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-largo-project-logo-320by320-12395a.png" alt="Logo for Project Largo" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The logo for <a href="http://largoproject.org/" class="media-link">Project Largo</a> by <a href="http://www.alliberry.com/">Alli Berry</a>.</div></div><p>For instance, we encourage authors to fill in their profiles. If they link to their Twitter account or to a Google+ profile, it automatically inserts all the authorship markup and associated metadata. We don’t make that a requirement, so we need to do a better job of explaining why it’s important to do so.</p><p>WordPress has a lot of optional stuff, like descriptions for categories, which can provide a lot of context on a category landing page. No one ever uses that, though. There’s also the proper use of metadata, so having categories, tags, and using them effectively. It’s so obvious to us, what should be a category versus a tag, but it’s not always clear to our authors. “I’ll just make a bunch of categories,” which is very common.</p><p>We need to do more training, like “Here’s the best way to…” There’s a lot of special styling available for elements within a story, but too often an author needs to know the exact markup for it to display correctly. We need to document that stuff, which will be one of the first tasks for the designer that we’re now hiring.</p><p>There aren’t any sites that I would point to as being great examples, but that’s totally my fault, it’s not their fault. There are a lot of sites that do the fundamentals pretty well, but there’s no one really maximizing that and that’s just something that we have to focus a little more on. Although there are sites that are doing some awesome stuff too.</p><p class="question"><strong>Do you take feature requests from organizations?</strong></p><p>We do, but we try to apply a filter to their requests. Even if it’s a good idea, not everything can be a priority, just because we may have more pressing responsibilities. If there’s something that someone identifies that a lot of members would find of value and we can ship it in a couple of hours, we’ll often just build it. But if it’s a feature that might take a little more time, thought, and care, we’ll add it to the backlog and the next version of the framework might include it.</p><p>For more one-off requests, when members say, “I want to be able to do this one very specific thing,” that in my estimation other members are unlikely to want, and it’s very narrow, then those are the types of things we’re now helping to implement with our paid consulting program.</p><p>We’ve thought about having a place where a member could submit these requests and filter them up and down to help us gauge interest and I expect that’s something we’ll do soon. For future versions of the framework, now that we’ve gotten most of the fundamental stuff out of the way, we’ll prioritize more based on feedback from our members.</p><p class="question"><strong>So I was reading your Twitter feed…</strong></p><p>Oh God…</p><p class="question"><strong>Hey I feel like you make the most of the format!</strong></p><p>[laughs]</p><p class="question"><strong>In a recent tweet you wrote that people will need to pay for their news. What does the future of journalism look like, both for your average reader and for news organizations?</strong></p><p>So that’s a big question. As far as revenue goes, the model in the 20th century was essentially, “We’ll sell ads in this newspaper, it will show up on your doorstep every morning, and you’re guaranteed delivery of those ads.” An advertiser would pay a premium to reach that audience, although whether or not the audience actually looked at the ads is questionable, even though the ads appeared intermingled with the content.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-full"><p class="quote-text">Folks, I hate to break this to you. But to fix the media you're all just going to have to pay for news. Sorry, just how it has to be.</p><cite class="citation-small">Adam Schweigert (<a href="https://twitter.com/aschweig/status/499014560464916481" class="citation-small--link">@aschweig</a>)</cite></blockquote><p>There would usually be multiple newspapers in a town and they would have different perspectives, so you could, for example, buy ads to display to a particular, partisan audience. That was basically all there was, so the newspapers would charge a premium to deliver those ads in an effective and reliable way. The ads were expensive and composed a majority of the income for the newspaper, which used the money to hire lots of staff and things were great. Subscription fees were only a fraction of the total revenue, which no longer works for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Today there’s much more diversity in media, especially online. Unfortunately for advertisers, banner ads are not effective. Everyone who’s ever seen one knows that you only click on them by accident. There’s a certain branding value to them, which is why luxury goods companies still pay for them, but otherwise they’re not effective. As a result, ad rates have dropped and are now approaching zero. It’s great for companies buying advertising, but terrible for the publishers, who are now trying to figure out how to make money. This is why advertising has becoming increasingly desperate, online and in print. It’s a race to the bottom to find the next advertising technique that’s even more disruptive to the reader, in order to charge more, all the while rates continue to slide off a cliff.</p><p>Instead, we need to diversify our revenue streams. There are a lot of organizations that are now looking at ads as a piece of the pie, but they also organize events or sell premium content, for example. A revenue model for a nonprofit would also include foundation grants and individual donations. With this new model it’s much less likely that any one source of revenue will ever pay for the entire cost of producing serious news. If you want serious accountability journalism, in my opinion, there’s just no way out of consumers having to pay for it.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-small media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><p class="quote-text">If you just expect to get your news for free as a result of advertisements, then you’re going to get what advertisers are going to pay for, which is editorially bankrupt journalism.</p></blockquote><p>If you just expect to get your news for free as a result of advertisements, then you’re going to get what advertisers are going to pay for, which is editorially bankrupt journalism. Some publications sell branded content, which is a slightly different story, but it’s still predicated on deception. It’s making the ads look enough like content in order to fool someone into accidentally reading it.</p><p>It’s an especially dangerous proposition for prestige brands, like The New York Times, because they risk diluting their brand by confusing consumers. The long term cost is an erosion of trust and that’s just not worth the money. At the moment you can get pretty good money for native advertising, but like other advertising, those rates are going to eventually continue to erode. I would rather see more organizations bite the bullet and just start charging for content than see them going down this slippery slope of blurring the lines between editorial and branded content.</p><p class="question"><strong>Where do you get your news from?</strong></p><p>All over the place. I get a lot of news from my Twitter feed and I always try to diversify the people I follow, so that I get perspectives outside of the media bubble. I’m actually pretty old, in internet terms anyway, so I have an RSS feed reader and still get news from that. I also subscribe to the Sunday New York Times, just because I enjoy drinking coffee and reading it, even though I’ve already read most of it by the time I get it! [laughs] I still enjoy that experience of reading it even though it’s probably, I don’t know what it is now, eight dollars an issue.</p><p class="question"><strong>Well, you get what you pay for.</strong></p><p>It’s more for the experience than the content that’s contained within it. I also listen to a lot of podcasts, a lot of public radio, and then obviously read content from INN member organizations. I can’t read it all, but I do try to share articles from there to give them a boost.</p><p class="question"><strong>Have you interacted with any of your favorite brands lately?</strong></p><p>[Laughing] My favorite brands? I just had an interaction with Charmin on Twitter. They were running a sponsored tweet, which didn’t make any sense, so I made a poop joke because that’s what Charmin does. That was my interaction with them. The way brands are using Twitter has gotten to be a little bit…</p><p class="question"><strong>Is there value in it? To them? Or for you?</strong></p><p>If it’s done well it can be very funny, but I don’t know that it’s effective, except in terms of awareness. The effectiveness of social media is a very similar question to the effectiveness of advertising in general, right? What are the goals? It’s become a requirement for customer service, but does it drive sales? I’m not convinced. We’re still in the early days of sponsored tweets, but the stuff I see tends to be from big national brands that I don’t buy anyway, so it hasn’t changed my behavior.</p><p>Right now it’s mostly jokes and the social media managers that run these accounts are so hardened, just because they need to be, I’m sure. Joking around with them is fun, knowing that there’s a person behind it who probably has a pretty good sense of humor. Certainly, it’s still a great way to get a brand’s attention if you have a bad experience. In my previous consulting life, a sort of gospel that I preached was that social media is more of a listening platform than a way to push a message, which just isn’t that effective in my opinion.</p><p class="question"><strong>So speaking of your previous life as a consultant, how’d you get into this line of work, what brought you to where you are now?</strong></p><p>It’s a long story. I double majored in music and biochemistry because I thought I was going to be a doctor, but I was paying for it with a music scholarship as an oboe player. After two years I ended up dropping biochem because juggling both majors was crazy without having any overlap between them.</p><p>So I spent five years and majored in oboe performance, music theory and music composition. But a music degree by itself is pretty much worthless, so of course I went to grad school. I went to <a href="http://www.iub.edu/">Indiana University</a>, which is a fantastic music school, to study composition, and added more of a computer music focus.</p><p>In grad school I got a part time job at <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/radio/">a public radio station</a>, where I started as a writer and producer. They eventually brought me on full time as the music director. I was probably the youngest classical music director in the history of public radio. It’s unusual because classical music is difficult to program. It’s not like pop songs, where you just play those same 40 songs. There is a thousand years of music and you need to assemble it in a way that flows well, yet is varied enough to still be interesting for both a more discerning audience and as background music for a typical dentist’s office.</p><p>After doing that for a couple years I was the person in the office who discovered podcasting. I told my co-workers that, “We should be doing this, this is the future.” We should be producing audio for the internet, not just putting our live stream online, so I started working more on the web at that point.</p><p>When I got that first full-time job I also decided to drop out of grad school, so I don’t have an actual master’s degree, which is kind of sad because I was pretty close and, particularly, because I had taken out a lot of student loans. I realized that I was not really into what I was doing. I was writing a lot of music that was esoteric enough that it was not really listenable, but was written more for winning awards.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://kinseyconfidential.org/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-kinsey-confidential-480by374-db3280.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-kinsey-confidential-320by249-db3280.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-kinsey-confidential-480by374-db3280.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-kinsey-confidential-320by249-db3280.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-kinsey-confidential-720by561-db3280.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-kinsey-confidential-480by374-db3280.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-screenshot-kinsey-confidential-320by249-db3280.jpg" alt="Kinsey Confidential" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The website for <a href="http://kinseyconfidential.org/" class="media-link">Kinsey Confidential</a>.</div></div><p>But I realized the skills that I had were translatable into doing other stuff. So in my role at the public radio station, I transitioned into being responsible for the website, as well as doing online content development. What was interesting to me, is that the radio station roughly covers the southern half of Indiana. On air, they reach about 40,000 people, but I don’t recall if that’s a week or month, it’s fairly small and Bloomington is a pretty small town. They have a geographically limited audience, but being in a college town that has a very rich cultural life and associations with the university, there is a lot of strength and possibility for building content partnerships.</p><p>So my strategy was to look for projects that we could develop for a national audience, which was a great success. We launched probably a dozen different blogs and podcasts that were often very topically focused on a particular strength of a partner organization, whether it be an academic department or the Kinsey Institute, which was one of our biggest successes. <a href="http://kinseyconfidential.org/">Kinsey Confidential</a> was a podcast about sexual health, where we had the opportunity to give, essentially, sex advice with a real solid research footing. It was probably the raciest thing public radio has ever touched, so I am very proud of that.</p><p>We also had a partnership with a local chef, <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/eartheats/">Earth Eats</a>, that was right around the beginning of the resurgence of the local food movement, the modern day farm-to-table kind of idea. We started a podcast and blog that was local food focused, which was one of the first in that space and it blew up too. By the time I left, this dinky station was among the top ten public radio websites nationally.</p><p class="question"><strong>What brought you to Columbus?</strong></p><p>I moved here to do similar work at <a href="http://wosu.org/">WOSU</a>, but it wound up not being a good fit, so I only stayed a year. I helped launch a web presence for their classical music station, which went pretty well. It was culturally hard because I wanted to move a little faster, build a team, be a little more aggressive. It just wasn’t where they were yet, but I do think they’re doing better now.</p><p>I then worked for just about year in consulting, mostly with companies in higher education, healthcare, and financial services. I did social strategy, analytics, and research. It was interesting, but I missed working in news and the nonprofit world, so I ended up starting <a href="http://mediatoybox.com/">my own firm</a>.</p><p>INN was actually a client of mine and after a while it turned into a full time job, which is how I got to where I am now. I still do a little bit of freelance work, but not much. It trailed way off because my focus is now solely on building a team and products to support nonprofit news at INN.</p><p>So it’s been been kind of a weird path.</p><p class="question"><strong>You are probably better for it, though.</strong></p><p>I am super grateful to have had the diversity of experience, even for those really hard years during my undergrad where I was juggling all of the math, science, and music. If I had only been a music major, I would never have taken that amount of math and chemistry. Having that research experience was really beneficial for me because it made me apply the scientific method to my decision making process, which I use and am grateful for today.</p><p class="question"><strong>Tell me about your hobbies. The ones I know about are gardening, cycling, and small Ohio towns.</strong></p><p>Food is a big thing for me, which began when I started editing that food podcast. I always enjoyed cooking, but didn’t really get that much into it. It’s amazing what covering food policy will do for how you eat. It’s around that time that I became a vegetarian. I now grow, can, and cook a lot of my own food. At my house I ripped out the entire backyard and built raised beds, and am now a fairly serious gardener. In the summertime I spend a lot of time on that, which I enjoy because it’s an opportunity to be away from the screen. The more time I spend in front of a screen the more time I like to spend doing things that feel more tangible.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aschweigert/10128224256/in/set-72157637789728673" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-photo-pleasantville-ohio-480by345-fe8300.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-photo-pleasantville-ohio-320by230-fe8300.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-photo-pleasantville-ohio-480by345-fe8300.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-photo-pleasantville-ohio-320by230-fe8300.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-photo-pleasantville-ohio-720by517-fe8300.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-photo-pleasantville-ohio-480by345-fe8300.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/02-adam-schweigert-photo-pleasantville-ohio-320by230-fe8300.jpg" alt="Pleasantville, Ohio" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">A photo from Pleasantville, Ohio</a>.</div></div><p>Photography has been a hobby of mine for a long time. I am also a pretty serious runner, but lately I’ve been doing more cycling. The cycling and photography are the two hobbies that go into my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aschweigert/collections/72157632128870392/">small towns project</a>. I was born in Akron and have lived in Ohio most of my life, but I realized that I have seen almost none of it since I have just driven the highways instead of seeing the smaller towns.</p><p>So as a way of getting out more and doing more photography, I go on a bike trip almost every weekend. I usually ride 50 or 60 miles and I try to find at least a few small towns, which I take photos of. I would like to eventually turn these photos into a book. For me, it’s about experiencing the diversity of the state at a human scale and photographing the characteristic architecture of small town Ohio. A lot of small towns have deteriorated as people leave, so I want to capture some of that architecture before it disappears. It’s an ongoing project and there are something like 280 small towns in Ohio…</p><p class="question"><strong>…Are you going to make it to them all?</strong></p><p>[Laughing] I don’t know if I will make it to all of them. I have been to about 50 or 60, so we will see how far I will get. Maybe next summer I will do more of a focused project and do a Kickstarter to go and reshoot some of it. Right now I just pick a spot and then ride all of these back roads to hit the towns along the way. There isn’t much of a plan to it, but maybe I will be more methodical about it next summer.</p><p>Over the last year music has become a hobby again, which is my first time back to it since I got burned out on it during grad school. I have been learning banjo, which is completely different, but equally challenging and a lot of fun. I don’t play in a band or anything yet, it’s more of a personal hobby.</p><p>What else? I usually get on a weird kick where I become randomly interested in something and will then need to know everything that exists about it. That covers a lot of it.</p><br><hr><p>You’ve just read about <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/adam-schweigert/">Adam Schweigert</a></strong> on <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/">Webworke.rs</a></strong>, a website about folks who make websites in Columbus, OH.</p><p>For updates, follow us on <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Webworkers614">Facebook</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://plus.google.com/+Webworkers614/">Google+</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/webworkers">LinkedIn</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://Webworkers614.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Webworkers614">Twitter</a></strong>.</p>

I went to school at the University of Cincinnati and studied Industrial Design, which is anything from shoes to furniture to cars; really it’s anything that’s three dimensional. I wanted to go to school for graphic design, because I was always interested in the way things look from an aesthetic view. But I found my way into industrial and that really opened my eyes to how things work. There are a lot of processes behind how you manufacture a table or a car tire, which are obviously very different things.</p><p>While I was in school I wanted to become a car designer, which led to a studio with Dodge. Those guys came down from Detroit to look at our work and critique it, which was good for us because we were getting input from the best designers in the world, and it was good for them because they were basically recruiting the top talent to go work for them once we graduated. But right before I graduated I decided that I didn’t want to do that for the rest of my life.</p><p>As I fell away from that, I then ended up designing indoor water parks across the country. I don’t know if you remember the craze about six or seven years ago when they were popping up all over the place. Developers were attaching them to hotels, just like the Fort Rapids that’s off I-70. Architects would go in and build these big structures and our company would go in and theme out the inside of them.</p><p>Along that same time I was doing more and more stuff online. I was heading up the marketing for a local nonprofit (<a href="https://www.snapcolumbus.org/">SNAP! Performance Productions</a>), working to help them generate buzz, tinkering around on websites, and one thing led to another. I jumped on Twitter in 2008, which is where I saw the job opening for <a href="http://www.bulx.com/">BULX.com</a>, a high end home improvement flash sale site. I created an online video for part of my application and they really liked it.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://bulx.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-bulx-480by374-db6e0e.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-bulx-320by249-db6e0e.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-bulx-480by374-db6e0e.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-bulx-320by249-db6e0e.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-bulx-720by561-db6e0e.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-bulx-480by374-db6e0e.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-bulx-320by249-db6e0e.jpg" alt="Bulx.com" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The website for <a href="http://bulx.com/" class="media-link">Bulx.com</a>.</div></div><p>Soon after, I joined BULX.com as the Director of Online Marketing and Social Media. It was a start-up out of <a href="http://www.techcolumbus.org/">Tech Columbus</a>, and there were only four of us in there who were in charge of the marketing and technology side. We had a partner in Chicago who was in charge of all the products. Everyday we’d have high end sinks, faucets, toilets, and rugs to sell for the home. We would get them at really deep discounts and they would be on sale anywhere from 40-80% off. Our team in Columbus was in charge of acquiring new members, loading all of the product into the site, and sending out the daily email for the sale.</p><p>We pretty quickly saw that we were acquiring customers much faster than our partner in Chicago was acquiring products, so our runway got really short, really quickly. We grew from zero members to over twenty thousand over the course of eight and a half months and generated hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue. We had this base of people expecting emails every day, but we didn’t always have something to sell them.</p><p class="question"><strong>That must have been an unexpected problem, since no one ever plans for too many customers.</strong></p><p>Right, exactly. BULX.com was eventually sold to a liquidator in New York, so they have access to a nearly unlimited supply of product to sell. I don't know what their growth strategy looks like today, but at the time it was a perfect fit. They had lots of product to move and they wanted a new audience for it, and we had a big audience we needed product for - so the acquisition made a lot of sense.</p><p class="question"><strong>My first introduction to your work was the fundraising campaign that you did for your friend Lindsay. Not only was the cause worthwhile, but the messaging was compelling. It had depth that really pulled me into it. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one. Previous to that, had you undertaken anything of that scope?</strong></p><p>It’s funny that you mention scope because there was never any plan to make it some massive initiative that gained national recognition. Eventually, it turned into something much bigger than I expected and was a little more work, but that was never the goal.</p><p>The <a href="http://forlindsay.com/">entire campaign</a> was literally an idea I came up with for a friend where I thought, “This is a story that people need to hear” and “I think I can make a difference in her life.”</p><div class="media--right media--1-2 media--min-200"><div class="FlexEmbed"><div class="FlexEmbed-ratio FlexEmbed-ratio--16by9"></div><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/48981619?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" class="FlexEmbed-content" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="media-caption">Video courtesy of <a href="http://beonscene.com/" class="media-link">OnScene Productions</a>.</div></div><p>Lindsay was a longtime friend who I was introduced to after moving back from Cincinnati. When she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer, it totally blindsided her, her husband, and all of their family because she was so young (only 27 at the time), active, and didn’t have any family history of the disease.</p><p>After battling cancer for nearly two years, she and her husband Tony decided they had waited long enough to start their family. They had been proactive about it before Lindsay started all the cancer treatments, but when it came time to start, the only option they had was to go through a surrogate. Because that process is so expensive (anywhere from $60,000 - $80,000, without using a surrogacy agency), I felt I could do something to help. I thought, “If money is the only thing standing between this awesome couple, who has already gone through so much, and their dream of having a family, there’s got to be something I can do to help them.”</p><p>Over the course of those four months leading up to the full marathon I ran in her honor, we ended up raising almost $28,000. And their son just had his first birthday party last month, which is awesome.</p><p>It’s interesting because some of the nonprofit work that I had been doing tied into the messaging and how I thought through the story I wanted to tell for Lindsay. But, how can you make it compelling enough for other people to care?</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><picture><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-for-lindsay-instagram-480by480-4ae1d0.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-for-lindsay-instagram-320by320-4ae1d0.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-for-lindsay-instagram-480by480-4ae1d0.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-for-lindsay-instagram-320by320-4ae1d0.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-for-lindsay-instagram-612by612-4ae1d0.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-for-lindsay-instagram-480by480-4ae1d0.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-for-lindsay-instagram-320by320-4ae1d0.jpg" alt="Matthew Russo after running For Lindsay" ></picture><div class="media-caption">Post marathon Instagram.</div></div><p>At the time I was training for a half marathon and I thought, “Yeah, I think I can do the full marathon.” Literally, while I was out on a training run, I had the idea to make a website for her and then turn this into something bigger. I met with the couple to tell them about my idea, and they loved it.</p><p>I looped in Eric Leslie from <a href="http://beonscene.com/">OnScene Productions</a>, who put together the video, which really was the focal point of the whole thing. It helped tell their story in a beautiful way and inspiring way.</p><p>It was my job to help get the word out, to start with the friends and family and let it spread from there. It was cool to literally see the story spread once people watched the video. Eventually, 69% percent of all the website traffic came from social media. People came to the site, saw the video, and were then compelled to donate to the cause and share it with their connections.</p><p class="question clear"><strong>That is the dream for a lot of people who manage brands.</strong></p><p>I think it’s something a lot of brands take for granted, or maybe don’t understand. If you build something from scratch and just expect people to show up, it’s probably not going to happen, even if it’s really well optimized for search.</p><p>You need that base of early adopters to get the ball rolling, so I started with friends and family.</p><p>It was perfect; a lot of my friends and family already knew Lindsay so it was the perfect tie to get them to spread the message. So I started local, close to home and let is spread from there. We had some tactics to build on that experience, too. Anyone who donated was added to an email list so we could keep them updated with the progress. We then used that base of people to help get the word out about other initiatives.</p><p>Do you remember what happened with Giuliana Rancic? We sent out a group email to everyone who already donated and asked, “Hey, do you want to help us reach out to this A-list celebrity?” And overwhelmingly people responded, “Hell yeah, I already donated. I’d like to help further this along.”</p><p>So I created a pre-populated tweet (using <a href="http://clicktotweet.com/">ClickToTweet.com</a>) that everyone tweeted at her. Guilianna got 20 or so of the same tweets at 8 in the morning, and by 9AM she then sent out <a href="https://twitter.com/GiulianaRancic/status/257845610198212608">an awesome tweet</a> and a link to her then 800,000 followers on Twitter, and that day blew up for the campaign.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-full"><p class="quote-text">Didn&#39;t expect tears at 9 am but this beautiful story is worth it. I&#39;m pulling &amp; praying 4 u Lindsay! Xo <a href="http://t.co/95AyjKAE">http://t.co/95AyjKAE</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ForLindsay?src=hash">#ForLindsay</a></p><cite class="citation-small">Giuliana Rancic (<a href="https://twitter.com/GiulianaRancic/" class="citation-small--link">@GiulianaRancic</a>)</cite></blockquote><p>There’s an interesting learning point to this. Her tweet sent 7,000 visitors to the site that day, at a time when we only had 6,500 hundred visitors leading up to that day. Those visitors (and I’m using air-quotes) “only” donated twelve or fifteen hundred dollars that day - which is awesome and we were really grateful for - but proportionally they should have donated much more based on how much people had been donating up to that point.</p><p>Again, that is a testament to people who are close to your message versus complete strangers. Everybody thinks that because it’s online and because it’s spread worldwide means the money is going to come pouring in. It’s actually easier to go through close friends and family than to spread the message to everybody and assume that it’s all going to come flowing in.</p><p class="question"><strong>Is Lindsay cancer free?</strong></p><p>She’s not. She’s still battling it every day. Her breast cancer spread to her back. For a while, they had it pretty well contained but she is battling through some pretty tough stuff again. She is so strong and has been kicking its ass for the past 5 years. If anyone can beat it for good, it’s her.</p><p>In the meantime, they are living their lives and I feel like I did my part to help contribute what I could. They are awesome people. I have no doubt they are going to get through it, but it is still a challenge. It’s a daily struggle for sure.</p><p class="question"><strong>Good luck to her and her family through this still trying experience.</strong></p><p class="question"><strong>Was Blast Brand your first solo foray into digital strategy and marketing?</strong></p><p>Yes, it was. When BULX.com was in the process of being acquired, I had to figure out what I wanted to do next. I knew it wasn’t going to be a nine to five at some big company, so I started my own company, which is <a href="http://www.blastbrand.com/">Blast Brand</a>.</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://blastbrand.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-blast-brand-480by374-5a0313.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-blast-brand-320by249-5a0313.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-blast-brand-480by374-5a0313.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-blast-brand-320by249-5a0313.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-blast-brand-720by561-5a0313.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-blast-brand-480by374-5a0313.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-blast-brand-320by249-5a0313.jpg" alt="Blast Brand" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The website for <a href="http://blastbrand.com/" class="media-link">Blast Brand</a>.</div></div><p>At the same time I started working with Mike Whaling over at <a href="http://30lines.com/">30 Lines</a>. It was just him when we started working together. I had a handful of clients that I acquired through Blast Brand, and he was looking for help because he had clients of his own that he was looking to grow. We have been working in tandem since. I have always maintained my clients, but I am now spending the majority of my time at 30 Lines. We are up to a team of eight full-time people, so that has grown significantly.</p><p>It’s interesting because there’s obviously a lot of overlap with what we provide and how we approach things, but our audiences are very different. Mike grew out of the multi-family apartment industry, so we build a lot of websites and do a lot of email marketing and social media for apartment communities in Columbus, Chicago, Florida, California, and up and down the East Coast.

In the industry, a lot of websites are built by what are essentially accounting companies, who provide software to manage the rent and the people who are living within these communities.</p><p>They said, “Wow, we have all this data, so we should become marketing companies too.” As a result they have these divisions that sell websites to integrate with their accounting software, but they approach it like an accounting company. They don’t have the marketing chops or the digital awareness of how websites should work or what the best practices are on the web. Yes, they are functioning websites, but they’re only now working towards making responsive websites, which has been the standard for several years now.</p><p>We approach it from the other side: What are best practices online? How can we drive traffic to the site? How can we increase the number of people who are requesting more information or applying on those websites? How can we do some cool, fun stuff to keep the funnel filled for these apartment websites?</p><p>We are building the integration in-between these front-end marketing sites and where all the data lives for real-time availability, pricing, and other metrics. It’s a WordPress plugin and it’s going to be pretty cool.</p><p class="question"><strong>Do these accounting companies provide APIs?</strong></p><p>Some of them.</p><p class="question"><strong>Most of the websites I’ve seen for apartment complexes are terrible, so there’s obviously a market there to improve upon the model.</strong></p><p>Yes. There are a handful of those providers currently, and some of their websites and documentation are better than others. Recently, one of them has been changing their API and we actually found out about it before some of their employees did. The feeds on a couple of our websites broke, and when our client asked us, “What’s going on?” we said, “OK, we’ll call this provider and see what’s up.” We called and they said, “Oh yeah, looks like the API changed. I guess we are going to scramble to put some documentation together about the fixes you guys need to make.” So that’s a lot of fun.</p><p class="question"><strong>The joys of making websites that depend on third party data, right?</strong></p><p>Exactly. There’s a ton of information to parse through, so it’s part of the challenge and opportunity. We need to figure out what to display on the back-end for our clients, while also considering how that ties into the front-end experience for potential renters.</p><p class="question"><strong>Neat. Good luck!</strong></p><p>I’ll keep you posted. It’s a fun challenge.</p><p class="question"><strong>So you have a lot of projects [laughing]. Could you give me a quick rundown of each? You’ve got ChatterJet. You’ve got Systems for Growth. And you’ve got Social Auto Leads. Am I forgetting any?</strong><p>None of the top level stuff, no.</p><p class="question"><strong>How many burners do you have?</strong></p><p>For example, <a href="http://webworke.rs/bryce-thornton/">Bryce Thornton</a> and I built <a href="http://chatterjet.com/">ChatterJet</a> after learning about the social media challenges that face small to medium-sized businesses. They kept telling me, “We know we should be doing social media, but we don’t know what the heck we should be doing. We also don’t know how to do it ourselves and we don’t have a big budget to pay for it.”</p><div class="media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://chatterjet.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-chatterjet-480by374-d818da.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-chatterjet-320by249-d818da.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-chatterjet-480by374-d818da.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-chatterjet-320by249-d818da.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-chatterjet-720by561-d818da.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-chatterjet-480by374-d818da.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-chatterjet-320by249-d818da.jpg" alt="ChatterJet" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The website for <a href="http://chatterjet.com/" class="media-link">ChatterJet</a>.</div></div><p>So with those three hypotheses, I said to Bryce, “Is there a way to automate and deliver custom content to these small businesses on an ongoing basis? How can we do it in a way that makes some money, too?” We built ChatterJet under those assumptions, but there’s also some limitations that we didn’t realize until we got into it.</p><p>We initially thought that it would be perfect for any small business, no matter what they do, but pretty quickly we learned that if you are a dry cleaner, social media probably isn’t not a great fit. This ties back to the messaging from the For Lindsay campaign. Who is really going to talk about dry cleaning? Who is doing the messaging behind that? Who’s really getting excited that their shirts are being well pressed? It’s more of a utility.</p><p>The other big piece is that the price point is so low that it doesn’t necessarily justify the time and money was being spent on social media for businesses like that. We would have dry cleaners sign up and they would say, “There aren’t a lot of people talking about dry cleaning on social media right now. Nobody is sharing our stuff, and it doesn’t make sense for us to just be posting stuff,” which I absolutely agree with.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://socialautoleads.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-social-auto-leads-480by374-a07ce5.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-social-auto-leads-320by249-a07ce5.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-social-auto-leads-480by374-a07ce5.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-social-auto-leads-320by249-a07ce5.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-social-auto-leads-720by561-a07ce5.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-social-auto-leads-480by374-a07ce5.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-social-auto-leads-320by249-a07ce5.jpg" alt="Social Auto Leads" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The website for <a href="http://socialautoleads.com/" class="media-link">Social Auto Leads</a>.</div></div><p>Some of the other lessons I learned from ChatterJet led me to <a href="http://socialautoleads.com/">Social Auto Leads</a>. If you can find products or services that people love talking about, that they are emotional about, and that have a high enough price point to justify the time and energy being spent on social media, then it makes sense to focus on that, which is what we did with Social Auto Leads.</p><p>Next, we looked at all the social media profiles for dealerships across the country and we realized that most of them are filled with horrible, awful stuff that nobody interacts with.</p><p>From a marketing checklist standpoint they are on Facebook, they are on Twitter, they are on Pinterest; but from a customer’s standpoint nobody is interacting with them. We said, “We can do this better,” so we started this as a service for auto groups and told them, “Hey, there is already a group of people online who are talking about their cars. We think we can start conversations with those people near your dealership. We think we can send you traffic and leads if it’s done right. So what do you say?”</p><p>So now we have clients in Columbus and Indianapolis. We are in talks with groups in New York and California, which is great, so the potential is there.</p><p>For the groups we’ve been working with over the last few months, we’ve already hit really great goals and not just on the impressions side, either. Everybody likes to see big, flashy numbers. For example, we generated 130,000 brand impressions on Twitter over the last three months for our local client alone.</p><p>But for me, it ultimately comes back to how many people are we sending through your dealership’s doors? How much traffic are we sending to your website? Those are the two focal points, especially on the website side, which is the focal point of your online presence. If we can do those two things everything else falls into place. Gaining followers is great, but that shouldn’t be the goal. Impressions shouldn’t be the goal and “Likes” shouldn’t be the goal, either. As we like to say, “Likes don’t sell cars. We do.”</p><p>We have been thinking about some cool opportunities to build for Social Auto Leads. There is an opportunity to take that model and expand it to other industries, too.</p><p class="question"><strong>What are your thoughts about the strengths and weaknesses of most brands with regards to their digital strategy?</strong></p><p>A lot of companies don’t know who their audience is, or who they are going after, or what they’re trying to achieve. They’re just reacting - looking at what everyone else is doing without understanding how it all works or ties together - and then launching things and expecting big results.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-small media--right media--1-4 media--min-200"><p class="quote-text">The code and the design is the easy part now. The challenge is finding an audience that actually cares and is willing to pay for your product because it delivers value to their organization.</p></blockquote><p>Especially with newer companies or start-ups, they thrash around and try to figure out what their product market fit is. So they spend a lot of time spinning their wheels and mistakenly thinking that “We just need to produce, to ship, and get our product out the door.” If they had a better understanding of who their client or prospective customer is and spent time talking to them to figure out what their challenges are, they would then have an easier time getting that product to the market.</p><p>There’s a ton of research about when it’s time to scale and when it’s time to put your head down and roll the product out, in the start-up space specifically. I won’t go into that, but if they spent more time talking to people, instead of putting their head down coding for a year because that is not what it’s about. The code and the design is the easy part now. The challenge is finding an audience that actually cares and is willing to pay for your product because it delivers value to their organization.</p><p>Telling your story in a compelling way, so that people are more willing to share it. I think that is the most interesting part to me right now. It’s not a problem with all brands, but a lot of brands need help. It such a competition right now to differentiate. We fight that, too. Not that we are struggling to find work, it’s the total opposite right now. But when there are a lot of people in town and across the country who have similar skill sets, you need to be very clear about what makes you different and the value you provide.</p><p class="question"><strong>What are your Systems for Growth. Are there systems in your life, in your career?</strong></p><p><a href="http://systemsforgrowth.com/">Systems for Growth</a> is my dumping ground for everything I’ve got going on in my head. I stumbled upon systems thinking a couple years ago. The basic premise is how do you piece everything together from a bigger picture standpoint, instead of just looking at individual elements. It’s how we approach our online presence, as well.</p><div class="media--left media--1-4 media--min-200"><a href="http://systemsforgrowth.com/" class="media-image--link"><picture><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-systems-for-growth-480by374-d8f68d.jpg" media="(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-systems-for-growth-320by249-d8f68d.jpg"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-systems-for-growth-480by374-d8f68d.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-systems-for-growth-320by249-d8f68d.jpg" media="(max-width: 320px)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-systems-for-growth-720by561-d8f68d.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 144dpi)"><source srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-systems-for-growth-480by374-d8f68d.jpg" media="(max-width: 480px)"><img srcset="/generated/01-matthew-russo-screenshot-systems-for-growth-320by249-d8f68d.jpg" alt="Systems For Growth" ></picture></a><div class="media-caption">The website for <a href="http://systemsforgrowth.com/" class="media-link">Systems For Growth</a>.</div></div><p>For example, clients often come to us and say, “Hey, we want help with our social media.” We look at their overall presence and we respond, “Actually, your website is a train wreck and you don’t even have an email service provider set up. There are all these other ideas you could be working on. Let’s table the social media and take care of some bigger picture items before spending time and money on things that aren’t going to move the needle.”</p><p>Systems for Growth is my personal blog where I put my thoughts about how to approach, not only online systems, but eventually time management and financial systems as well. It’s my playground to dump my thoughts and experiment with this way of thinking.</p><p>I recently presented some of my thoughts from the blog at the Ohio Growth Summit in a session called “<a href='http://systemsforgrowth.com/four-pillars-business-growth/'>Why Building Bridges is Better Than Building Islands</a>”. The blog isn’t really something I really have to do on top of everything else, since it ties into everything I’m working on already. As a result, it gives me a place to collect my thoughts and share them with others.</p><p class="question"><strong>Speaking of family, you and your wife have a daughter?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p class="question"><strong>I’m sure your lives have changed in the past year. How do you manage work and life balance?</strong></p><p>Yes, it has. It has made me aware of how I spend my time at home and made me better at drawing borders between when I should be working and when I shouldn’t. It is very easy for us in the online world to think, “Hey, I’ve got a laptop and a connection, so I could be working right now.”</p><p>There's obviously value in disconnecting and spending time with family, old friends, and new connections. That has been the biggest change. When I get home, I am at home until my daughter goes to bed at least. Then, if I can put my head down for an hour or two at night, that’s fine. If I’m with her or my wife, that is what I’m focusing on.</p><p class="question"><strong>What is your typical work day? Is there a typical work day?</strong></p><p>Yeah, I am more of a morning person now that I have a daughter who wakes up around 6:15 AM. So coming to coffee wasn't so bad this morning, which is great.</p><p>My day typically starts with spending time with my family for an hour or so. Then, I get ready and come into the office, where I’ll write for a bit, either for Systems for Growth or some of the other places I contribute, such as my small column for <a href="http://www.themetropreneur.com/columbus/category/features/systems-for-growth/">The Metropreneur</a>. Then, I jump into email and see if there’s anything urgent and compare it to what’s on the agenda for the day. I figure out all the stuff that I need to get done this week. Then I divvy up and prioritize my work for the rest of the day. In the evening, I go home and spend some time with my family. If there’s any lingering stuff or any planning for the next day or the remainder of the week, I do that.</p><p class="question"><strong>Any hobbies when you have some free time?</strong></p><p>[Laughing] I have free time.</p><p class="question"><strong>Do you still run?</strong></p><p>Yes, I do. I’m currently training for the BTN Big 10K in Chicago, which is fun. Awhile back I wrote an article about how you can <a href="http://www.themetropreneur.com/columbus/create-time-life/">create more time in your life</a> with the word “and”. I’ve been thinking a lot about how you can do two things at once or three things at once. It’s not so much a multi-tasking concept, as much as it’s, “What things can I do that I value in life that pair well together?”</p><p>One of the things that I like to do is run, right? So how can I bring my family into that? Recently, I’ve been training by pushing my daughter in her running stroller (which she loves), and I’ve got a goal to run a number of races across the country. But instead of travelling to these races by myself, why not bring my family with me so we get to spend time together? I get to achieve some individual goals, spend quality time with my family, and see some new cities in the meantime.</p><p>For example, I ran the Nashville Half Maration in April. We have the Chicago race coming up in a few weeks. We also get to spend time with friends. We went down to Nashville with my brother and his girlfriend. When we go to Chicago we’ll spend some time with some friends from high school. It’s nice to see the country, do some fun stuff, and eat some good food too.</p><p class="question"><strong>I just recently went to Nashville this past spring and I really enjoyed it.</strong></p><p>Had you been there before?</p><p class="question"><strong>No, I had not. Living in Columbus, it’s far enough away, but it’s still approachable. You don’t need to buy a plane ticket, plus it doesn’t break the bank. It’s the same thing with Chicago.</strong></p><p>My wife and I have a general rule. Every year for our anniversary, we go somewhere new. We’ve been to Niagara Falls and Washington D.C. We actually did Detroit last year, which is only a three hour drive from Columbus, but we’d never been there. It was awesome. We have a rule to check out as much stuff close by. We haven’t been to Indianapolis, even though it’s right across the border, so we are going to do that soon. There’s so much opportunity nearby that we take for granted. People have these big aspirations like “I need to go to Europe. And I need to go to Southeast Asia.” I’m like, “Why don’t you drive six hours and go see St. Louis?”</p><p class="question"><strong>Yeah, you may not even know your own country.</strong></p><p>Yeah for sure.</p><p class="question"><strong>Do you have any clients that you are really excited about?</strong></p><p>They are all interesting in their own regard. It’s less about individual clients and more about determining if what they’re trying to achieve is interesting and worth our time.</p><p>It’s also about figuring out what their digital presence can and should look like. You need to have a website. You need to be doing email. I like to to take the approach of: this is your situation, this is the story you want to tell, these are your goals, this is the audience you are trying to reach - let’s figure out which levers to pull that are going to get you the most impact or bang for your buck.</p><p>Should you be doing everything online? Probably, eventually. To me it usually doesn’t make sense to set all these different platforms up, and then press go, just to see it wither away because you don’t have the resources to get it where it needs to be. Why don’t we start with the website and run a Twitter campaign or do some social listening to validate you ideas? Once that’s working, what can we add on next so that it’s building on itself and you aren’t killing yourself in the process. Customizing that approach for each client is what’s most interesting for me.</p><blockquote class="quote quote-full"><p class="quote-text">Today, it’s teaming up with people who have good stories to tell and who want to make an impact on the world is more interesting to me than someone coming to me with some money and saying, “We have this budget. Can you build something for us?”</p></blockquote><p>I am getting more selective on the types of projects I work on. When you are just starting out you take anything. The quantity breeds quality kind of stuff. Today, it’s teaming up with people who have good stories to tell and who want to make an impact on the world is more interesting to me than someone coming to me with some money and saying, “We have this budget. Can you build something for us?” Yes, we can build that for you, but what is it going to do in the long term? That is the question I keep in the back of my head.</p><p class="question"><strong>What is next for you personally, professionally? For Blast Brand or 30 Lines?</strong></p><p>My goal is always to keep growing, both on the personal level and business level. It comes back on the business side to making an impact. What can we do at scale so that we aren’t all over the place all the time? We fight this a lot internally because a.), we know how to do it all now and we see how that puzzle fits together and b.) our clients want it all.</p><p>It’s the groupthink of clients hearing about things online, “Vine is the new cool thing. All the kids are on Snapchat. Why don't we do something over there?”</p><p>It’s really easy for us to say that sounds fun, so let’s go try that out, without thinking about how that impacts our work flow internally or our client’s bottom lines. But it’s our job to ask the tough questions like, “Why do you think that’ll work for your organization” and “What do you hope to achieve with it?”</p><p>That’s not to say that we don’t like experimenting or we don’t like trying new things. Certain things work because they are new. Now, let’s figure out how to make them work for a lot of people, so that we can spend time providing value in an efficient way, instead of spinning our wheels, trying everything all over the place, and not seeing much progress from that.</p><br><hr><p>You’ve just read about <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/matthew-russo/">Matthew Russo</a></strong> on <strong><a href="http://webworke.rs/">Webworke.rs</a></strong>, a website about folks who make websites in Columbus, OH.</p><p>For updates, follow us on <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Webworkers614">Facebook</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://plus.google.com/+Webworkers614/">Google+</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/webworkers">LinkedIn</a></strong>, <strong><a href="http://Webworkers614.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Webworkers614">Twitter</a></strong>.</p>
